// own, which matters more here than usual: the entire value of the warning
// depends on it not crying wolf.
//
// Background: skills imported before supporting-file install shipped carry only
// their SKILL.md. An agent following instructions that invoke `scripts/foo.sh`
// then fails at use time with a missing-file error, producing degraded output
// rather than a visible break. This is the safety net that says so; the fix is
// re-importing or syncing the skill.
