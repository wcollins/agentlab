![Gridctl](assets/dashboard.png)

Gridctl aggregates tools from [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers into a single gateway and serves [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) as MCP prompts to upstream clients. Define your stack in YAML, apply with one command, and connect Claude Desktop (or any MCP client) through one endpoint.

```bash
gridctl apply stack.yaml
```

Designed for fast, ephemeral, stateless environments, inspired by [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev).

## ⚡️ Why gridctl

MCP servers are everywhere: different transports, different hosting models, different `.json` files accumulating like dust. Skills are a separate sprawl on top. Switching projects shouldn't mean rewriting every client config.

Gridctl gives you one declarative file for everything you want connected, one local endpoint your client talks to, and a UI that shows you what's actually running. Build fast, throw it away, rebuild it tomorrow.

```yaml
version: "1"
name: daily

#  Secret set passed in at runtime
secrets:
  sets:
    - dev

network:
  name: daily-net
  driver: bridge

# Global gateway configuration
gateway:
  name: dev
  code_mode: on

# LLM clients auto-linked to this gateway on apply
link:
  - claude
  - claude-code
  - cursor
  - antigravity
  - grok

# Downstream MCP servers behind the gateway
mcp-servers:

  # Jira and Confluence via Atlassian's hosted remote MCP.
  # Authorize once with `gridctl auth login atlassian`; tokens are stored
  # encrypted and refreshed automatically.
  - name: atlassian
    url: https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp/authv2
    auth:
      type: oauth

  # GitHub repos, issues, and PRs (containerized stdio server)
  - name: github
    image: ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:latest
    transport: stdio
    env:
      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${var:GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}

  # Browser automation and page inspection
  - name: playwright
    command:
      - npx
      - '@playwright/mcp@latest'

  # SaaS app actions through Zapier's hosted MCP endpoint.
  # Same flow: `gridctl auth login zapier` after apply.
  - name: zapier
    url: https://mcp.zapier.com/api/v1/connect
    auth:
      type: oauth
```

## 🪛 Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gridctl/gridctl/main/install.sh | sh
```

Installs the latest release to `~/.local/bin/gridctl`. Full instructions for Homebrew, pre-built binaries, building from source, container runtime setup, and updating/uninstalling are in the [Installation guide](docs/installation.md).

## 🚦 Quick Start

```bash
# Or scaffold your own starter stack.yaml
gridctl init

# Apply the example stack
gridctl apply examples/getting-started/mcp-basic.yaml

# Check what's running
gridctl status

# Open the web UI
open http://localhost:8180

# Clean up
gridctl destroy examples/getting-started/mcp-basic.yaml
```

## 🖥️ Connect LLM Application

The easiest way to connect is with `gridctl link`, which auto-detects installed LLM clients and injects the gateway configuration:

```bash
gridctl link              # Interactive: detect and select clients
gridctl link claude       # Link a specific client
gridctl link --all        # Link all detected clients at once

# Local-model clients bog down on large tool lists; link a smaller
# surface via a tool group (or enable gateway code_mode)
gridctl link lmstudio --group <name>
```

Declaring a `link:` block in stack.yaml (as above) does the same thing on every `gridctl apply`: each listed client is linked idempotently once the gateway is healthy, and clients that aren't installed warn and skip. `gridctl destroy --unlink` removes those entries again.

Already have MCP servers configured in your clients? `gridctl import` runs the same detection in reverse: it scans those configs (read-only), dedupes the servers it finds, and appends your selection to stack.yaml, offering plaintext secrets into the encrypted variable store on the way.

Supported clients: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Gemini, Antigravity, OpenCode, Grok Build, Continue, Cline, AnythingLLM, LM Studio, Roo, Zed, Goose

<summary>Manual configuration</summary>

#### Most Applications
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gridctl": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8180/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gridctl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8180/mcp", "--allow-http"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after editing. All tools from your stack are now available.

#### Antigravity
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gridctl": {
      "serverUrl": "http://localhost:8180/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Antigravity borrows Windsurf's `serverUrl` field but speaks streamable HTTP, so point it at the `/mcp` endpoint (not `/sse`). The IDE and CLI share `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` on Antigravity 2.0. Since Antigravity caps each MCP server at 100 tools, pair a large stack with `gateway.code_mode: on`.

## 🎬 Features

### Stack as Code

Declarative, version-controlled MCP environments. Validate before you commit, plan before you apply, and detect the moment your environment drifts from what's in version control. Drift detection runs in the background: the canvas flags servers running but absent from your spec, and declarations in your spec that haven't been deployed.

```bash
gridctl search postgres        # Find servers in the catalog and the MCP Registry
gridctl add github             # Append a catalog server to stack.yaml by name
gridctl validate stack.yaml    # Lint and schema-check the spec (exit 0/1/2)
gridctl plan stack.yaml        # Diff against running state
gridctl apply stack.yaml       # Apply the spec
gridctl export                 # Reverse-engineer stack.yaml from a running stack
```

### Generated Python Containers

Build an exact public PyPI release, or a packaged Python project from git or a
local directory, without maintaining a Dockerfile. Generated images use pinned
Python and uv bases, run as a non-root user, and keep existing host `uvx`
workflows unchanged. In the web UI, choose the Python Package template or the
Generated Python source strategy; eligible catalog packages also offer a
`Run in a container` toggle that is off by default.

```yaml
mcp-servers:
  - name: fetch
    source:
      type: pypi
      package: mcp-server-fetch
      ref: 2026.8.18

  - name: time
    source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers.git
      ref: d73f99efbfd40c3aa1b61e88728b3d49fb52608f
      path: src/time
      runtime: python
```

### `gridctl optimize` & Usage Observability

Every tool call's arguments and results are token-counted per server, replica, client, and tool, and the Metrics workspace charts throughput, call counts, and the savings from output format conversion (measured from the gateway's own before/after counts). `gridctl optimize` scans the running gateway and surfaces actionable findings with projected weekly token impact (unused servers, unused tools, schema overhead, and format-conversion shortfalls), plus a paste-ready YAML remediation for each.

```bash
gridctl optimize                          # styled findings table
gridctl optimize --format json            # machine-readable OptimizeReport
gridctl optimize --severity warn,critical # narrow to actionable findings
```

Learn more → [Usage Observability](docs/usage-observability.md)

### Output Format Conversion

Tool call results default to JSON. Set `output_format` at the gateway or per-server level to convert structured responses into `TOON` or `CSV` before they reach the client, reducing token consumption by **25–61%** for tabular and key-value data. Non-JSON responses and payloads over 1 MB are passed through unchanged.

```yaml
gateway:
  output_format: toon      # Default for all servers: json, toon, csv, text

mcp-servers:
  - name: analytics
    output_format: csv     # Override per server
```

Learn more → [Configuration Reference](docs/config-schema.md)

### Tool Surface Control

A large stack floods the client's context with tools it will never call. Three axes compose: the per-server `tools:` whitelist narrows what exists, `groups:` bundle tools across servers behind their own endpoint at `/groups/{name}/mcp`, and `clients:` restricts what each linked client may touch.

```yaml
groups:
  release:
    servers: [github]                      # every tool of these servers
    tools: [gitlab__create_merge_request]  # plus specific prefixed tools
    exclude: [github__delete_repo]         # subtract, applied last
```

```bash
gridctl groups                     # Groups, member counts, and endpoints
gridctl link cursor --group release
```

With `gateway.auth` configured, grouped endpoints require the same bearer token or API-key header as `/mcp` on every request. Linking selects an endpoint but does not provision credentials; supply them through your client's authentication settings. Groups and self-declared client selectors are not authenticated identities. See [gateway authentication](docs/config-schema.md#auth), including HTTPS or encrypted-tunnel requirements for remote access.

### Rate Limits

Cap call rates per client, server, or tool, enforced at tool-call dispatch, so a runaway agent stops at the limit instead of hammering a server. Omitting the block limits nothing.

```yaml
limits:
  rate_limits:
    - server: github
      calls_per_minute: 30
      burst: 10
```

```bash
gridctl limits                     # Every rate limit and its state
```

Learn more → [Configuration Reference](docs/config-schema.md)

### Schema Pinning

Gridctl pins every tool definition the first time it sees it and flags drift on later applies, so a server that quietly rewrites a tool's description or schema surfaces as a reviewable diff instead of reaching your agent unnoticed. Pinned definitions are also scanned for injection signals: hidden instructions, sensitive-file references, hidden Unicode, and cross-server tool shadowing. Skill documents get the same trust-on-first-use treatment (`gridctl skill pins`): per-file digests over the whole document set, drift held for human approval, and the same injection heuristics as advisory findings.

```bash
gridctl pins verify                # Exit 1 on drift
gridctl pins diff github           # Per-tool before/after plus scan findings
gridctl pins approve github        # Re-pin after review
```

Learn more → [Configuration Reference](docs/config-schema.md)

### Downstream Authorization

For OAuth-protected remote servers, gridctl is the OAuth client: one browser login serves every connected LLM client, with tokens encrypted on disk and refreshed automatically. An unauthorized server deploys in a `needs auth` state rather than failing the stack.

```yaml
mcp-servers:
  - name: notion
    url: https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
    auth:
      type: oauth
```

```bash
gridctl auth login notion
gridctl auth status
```

Learn more → [Configuration Reference](docs/config-schema.md)

### Scoped Variable Delivery

Keep secrets and environment-specific configuration in the variable store (encrypted at rest when locked), declare value-free prerequisites in `stack.yaml`, and inspect where each key is consumed without exposing its value. Delivery stays explicit: stack references and scoped sets feed workloads, while `var run` selects the keys made available to a child process.

```yaml
variables:
  GITHUB_TOKEN:
    required: true
    description: Token used by the GitHub server

mcp-servers:
  - name: github
    env:
      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${var:GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

```bash
gridctl var explain GITHUB_TOKEN     # Resolution, declaration, and consumers
gridctl var run --only GITHUB_TOKEN -- gh auth status
gridctl var scan --staged            # Exact-value check before commit
```

Names beginning with `GRIDCTL_`, plus `OP_CONNECT_TOKEN` and `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`, are reserved for gridctl control-plane credentials and cannot be delivered to workloads.

### Skill Library

Every `SKILL.md` in your registry surfaces to upstream MCP clients as a prompt. Author in the Library workspace in the web UI (or via `gridctl skill *` on the CLI), activate, and the prompt becomes available to Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or anything that speaks MCP.

```bash
gridctl skill list                        # Show what's in the registry
gridctl skill add <git-repo>              # Import skills (and agents) from a remote repo
gridctl activate my-skill                 # Promote a draft → active
```

Skills follow the [agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io): author them as plain markdown with frontmatter and they work with every skill-aware client, not just gridctl.

The registry holds more than skills. The same import pipeline discovers Claude Code subagent definitions (`agents/*.md`), and `gridctl skill project sync` places both onto disk for clients that read files instead of MCP: identity copies for Claude Code, rendered dialects for OpenCode, Copilot, and Gemini CLI. A shared lockfile tracks every projected file, so drift is detected, hand edits are adoptable, and unsync removes exactly what gridctl wrote. The global context can likewise become a library of rule fragments with per-client assembly; see [Global Context Sync](docs/global-context.md).

### Packs

A pack is a git repo with a `gridctl-pack.yaml` manifest: a versioned selection of skills, agents, rule fragments, and gateway wiring that imports and applies as one unit, so a team setup is one command instead of a checklist.

```bash
gridctl pack add <git-repo>               # Clone, scan, and import the manifest's selection
gridctl pack apply team-pack              # Project everything to detected clients
gridctl pack remove team-pack             # Cascade removal by pack tag, never by name match
```

Every projection a pack applies is tagged with the pack name in the lockfile, which is what makes `pack status` and removal exact: resources you created yourself are never claimed or deleted.
