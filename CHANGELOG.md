# Changelog

All notable changes to gridctl will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation

- Correct the API reference's grouped-auth exemptions and remote gateway setup guidance, and clarify credential requirements in group and client-linking documentation (#1223).
- Python source examples now include a practical daily stack that builds the Fetch server from an exact PyPI release and the Time server from a commit-pinned project in the official MCP servers monorepo. The guide explains source pins, generated command selection, and build and runtime network behavior.

### Security

- Configured gateway authentication now covers grouped MCP and SSE routes, including initialization, discovery, calls, stream replay, and session deletion. Grouped clients that omitted credentials must send the same bearer token or API-key header required by `/mcp` on every request. Public UI files, probes, terminal CORS preflight, and the exact state-validated downstream OAuth callback remain public; no-auth loopback, valid credential formats, and all supported MCP protocol generations remain unchanged (#1223)
- Variable names beginning with `GRIDCTL_`, plus `OP_CONNECT_TOKEN` and `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`, are now reserved for gridctl bootstrap and control-plane credentials. New store writes reject them, imports skip them with key-only warnings, exports and variable-set injection omit legacy entries, and local MCP processes no longer inherit them from the gridctl daemon. `${var:...}` and `${vault:...}` references to reserved keys remain literal and return a distinct resolution error without falling back to the ambient environment. Ordinary environment interpolation of non-credential `GRIDCTL_*` values remains supported. This is a compatibility-sensitive security boundary for the next major release; remove legacy entries with `gridctl var delete KEY --force` after moving any downstream credential to a non-reserved name (#1186)

### Bug Fixes

- The Library no longer claims that intentionally external `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` paths are missing from a complete imported skill package. New imports record that all managed supporting-file trees were evaluated, while legacy and local skills retain the missing-file warning.
- Container stdio MCP servers no longer report a phantom allocated host port during apply, reload, or autoscaling. Stdio workloads publish no ports, while HTTP/SSE workloads continue to receive sequential published ports among themselves.
- Documentation now covers scoped variable delivery across the README, architecture map, REST wire shapes, stack schema inventory, and variable examples. The remote-gateway example no longer instructs users to store a reserved `GRIDCTL_*` control-plane key.
- A downstream MCP server that is unreachable when gridctl registers it (at startup, via hot-reload add or modify, or via a failed restart) is no longer dropped for the life of the process. Retryable failures enter a pending-registration loop driven by the health monitor: an immediate scan when the monitor starts, then attempts on each cycle gated by exponential backoff (capped at 30s), each preceded by a short reachability probe so a still-down endpoint costs about two seconds rather than a full ready window. Status output shows the failed server with a `retrying in Ns` hint instead of a terminal-looking error, and `POST /api/mcp-servers/{name}/restart` (the UI Restart button) on such a server forces an immediate attempt instead of returning 404. Removing the server (reload or unregister) drops the retry state, and a generation guard makes sure an attempt already in flight can never re-register a server that was removed or replaced meanwhile. Authorization failures (owned by the OAuth login flow), configuration errors (which fail identically every time), and container HTTP/SSE servers whose container was removed after a readiness timeout stay out of the loop. The practical effect: the strict "backends first, then gridctl, then AI clients" start order is gone - declared servers that come up late join the gateway automatically (#1180)

### Features

- The create-server wizard now supports generated Python containers for exact PyPI packages and packaged Git or local sources, including backend-resolved package versions, advanced Python inputs, server-level command and mount serialization, and lossless Python source round trips through Expert YAML mode. Eligible catalog PyPI entries retain host `uvx` by default and offer an explicit container toggle, with required mount details for filesystem inputs. Review shows the shared backend build plan and generated Dockerfile, waits for registration instead of reporting an append as deployment success, links to server-filtered logs, and both server sidebars show matching Python source and image provenance.
- The REST API now validates individual wizard resources, resolves bounded and cached public-PyPI version inventories, previews immutable Python build plans, and returns the exact generated Dockerfile from the shared builder implementation. MCP status payloads identify generated Python containers and expose their declared pin, actual versioned image tag, and image-recorded commit or artifact provenance.
- Python source containers now have complete CLI support: `gridctl plan` resolves first-class build actions with immutable source identity, image tag, and cache state, while `--show-dockerfile` exposes the exact generated file in text and JSON output. Resolution failures remain visible beside the config diff and block apply. Apply and reload emit structured per-server phases and INFO image-build diagnostics. `gridctl add --container` writes exact structured PyPI or credential-free commit-pinned GitHub sources without changing the default host `uvx` catalog path, and `gridctl doctor` warns when host `uvx` is unavailable without requiring it for container workflows. The schema reference, CLI reference, troubleshooting guidance, and copy-paste PyPI example cover the new workflow and its security limits.
- Stack sources can now opt into generated Python containers with `runtime: python`, including exact public PyPI releases and packaged git or local projects in validated subdirectories. Generated builds select a compatible Python 3.10-3.13 image, resolve console scripts without executing package code on the host, preserve explicit Dockerfile precedence, and carry Python options and pinned-image provenance through content-addressed builds.
- Source image builds now reuse an existing image only when its `io.gridctl.build-input-digest` label matches the resolved build plan, and built images carry non-secret build-input and source provenance labels. The builder also gains bounded official-PyPI release resolution, hash-verified wheel metadata inspection, static `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py` parsing, Python 3.10-3.13 compatibility selection, deterministic console-script resolution, and a digest-pinned, non-root uv Dockerfile generator.
- Source-based MCP servers now resolve and build one desired image per logical server before container reconciliation. Static replicas, hot reload replacements, and autoscaled spawns use that exact image instead of rebuilding per replica or reconstructing a mutable `latest` tag, and stale containers are replaced when their image differs. Container MCP servers also accept validated `volumes` mounts that reach static, reloaded, and autoscaled workloads.
- Source image builds now resolve Git refs to full commits in isolated builder worktrees, report mutable branch refs in resolved plans, and use content-addressed image tags instead of `latest`. Build identity includes source content, Dockerfile selection, build arguments, command, and target platform, while config plan and hot reload share complete effective server and source comparison.
- Scoped variable delivery is complete: `gridctl var explain` reports value-free store, environment, declaration, and consumer resolution; `gridctl var run` injects an explicit set/key selection into direct child processes with streaming exact-value redaction and signal forwarding; and `gridctl var scan` checks working-tree or staged Git content for exact stored secret values. Stored variables gain description, docs, example, and deprecation metadata with JSON and `.env` round trips. Stack and pack manifests can declare advisory, value-free variable prerequisites, with inheritance diagnostics, versioned pack persistence, and actionable unmet-variable output (#1188)
- `gridctl models` (Experimental) manages one model routing policy document (`~/.gridctl/models/policy.yaml`) and projects it into a LiteLLM auto-router config fragment plus an OpenCode provider stanza, giving a self-hosted mixed local-and-cloud model fleet a versioned source of truth with the same ownership, drift, and backup guarantees as skill and context projection. The rendered fragment carries only the router (LiteLLM's `include:` extends `model_list` across files, so backends stay declared once in the user's own config and are referenced by name; re-emitting them would silently load-balance duplicates), the `include:` line is a single-line text edit that leaves the rest of the parent config byte-identical, and the OpenCode write is an RFC 6902 patch that owns only the provider subtree and never touches the user's top-level `model` pick. Because LiteLLM reads config only at startup, sync latches a `restart-pending` state that only `gridctl models ack-restart` clears, and the sync output distinguishes "file written" from "policy live". The verb family (`init` with topology templates or `--from-litellm` scaffolding, `edit`, `validate`, `render`, `sync` with `--dry-run --diff` and `--check`, `status`, `adopt`, `unsync`, `ack-restart`) follows the projection house conventions, `gridctl reset` covers the new kind, and the rendered schema is contract-checked in CI by booting a digest-pinned LiteLLM release (v1.97.0, Auto Router v2) against a fragment included from a human-shaped config (#1178)
- The model routing policy gains a web surface (Experimental, inheriting the CLI feature's tier): a Model routing dialog in the Connections workspace (an always-visible header action, plus a summary section with a deep link in OpenCode's detail pane) showing per-target projection status, the policy's tier-to-backend routing summary, validation findings, and drift review with unified diffs, with the whole-policy verbs as gated actions: preview (dry-run diff), sync, accept-on-disk-as-owned (adopt), overwrite-with-policy (forced sync), and a confirmed "Mark restarted" that clears the restart-pending latch (rendered as an annotation chip, never an attention state, mirroring the engine's `NeedsAttention` contract). OpenCode drift joins the Connections client-health attention axis; the LiteLLM targets belong to no client and surface only in the dialog. Backed by new `/api/project/models/{status,validate,sync,adopt,ack-restart}` endpoints on the shared projection-handler conventions (`[]` not `null`, engine refusals as 409s with their message verbatim, validate-before-sync so an invalid policy returns findings instead of a 500), with the REST reset engine now sharing the same lazily built manager. The policy document itself stays CLI-edited by design; there is no browser editor (#1182)

## [0.1.0-rc.3] - 2026-08-22

Third release candidate. Adds LM Studio as the 16th `gridctl link` client, live-verified against a real 0.4.x install, along with a post-link notes channel that surfaces client-specific guidance in both the CLI and the Connections detail pane.

### Features

- `gridctl link lmstudio` connects LM Studio (an MCP host since 0.3.17) to the gateway: a url-only streamable-HTTP `gridctl` entry written into `~/.lmstudio/mcp.json` with wiring ownership, the stack.yaml `link:` block, `gridctl import`, and the Connections workspace all included. The entry carries no `type` key (LM Studio's in-app editor strips unknown keys), and session attribution maps the app's `clientInfo.name` to the `lmstudio` slug. After a successful link, client-specific notes cover the version floor, lazy server loading, per-tool approval, the distinction from the OpenAI-compatible API on port 1234, and a tip to prefer `--group` or code mode for local models; the same notes appear on the client's Connections detail pane, sourced from the backend so future clients with caveats need no frontend work. `gridctl ctx` reports LM Studio as unsupported (system prompt is per-chat in the app UI), and `gridctl link lms` explains that `lms` is the headless CLI rather than the MCP host (#1165)

## [0.1.0-rc.2] - 2026-08-19

Second release candidate. Adds `gridctl reset` and its web UI dialog, the `GRIDCTL_HOME` override, pack import credentials across CLI, REST, and both wizards, and an OpenAPI operations picker in the create-server wizard, plus fixes for OpenAPI TLS handling, the operations filter, and the pack wizard crash.

### Features

- The web UI gains the reset surface: a danger-zone strip at the foot of the Connections workspace (plus a command-palette entry) opens a Reset gridctl dialog backed by the same engine as `gridctl reset`. The dialog opens on the server's dry run and renders nothing actionable until it resolves, so the blast radius the user confirms is the one the engine computed: removable artifacts grouped per client with expand-to-detail, hand-edited items in a calm amber "your edits are safe" section rather than the removal list, and an explicit statement per client that everything else there is untouched. The two tiers are stacked radio cards whose labels name outcomes and paths, with the purge card red-bordered at rest, not only when selected, so the heavier option can never read as the milder one; switching tiers refetches the preview because the confirm token is tier-bound. Purge requires typing the resolved state-directory path the preview returned, the same string the server enforces, so the browser gate is real rather than decorative. Escape and backdrop clicks are inert while the reset runs, results are announced in-dialog through a live region (never a toast, which has none), partial failures list each failed row with the server's error verbatim and the idempotent-retry remediation, and both tiers finish by reloading the page: the serving daemon sits inside the blast radius either way, so the stores describe a world that no longer exists (#1142)

- `gridctl reset` removes everything gridctl placed on a machine, in one ownership-driven pass: projected skills, agents, and context rules in client directories, the gateway entries gridctl owns inside shared client MCP configs, and every stack's daemons, containers, and networks. The default tier preserves `~/.gridctl` (vault, oauth grants, pins, registry, cache, telemetry, logs); `--purge` deletes it too, behind a typed confirmation of the exact resolved path. Removal is driven by the projection lockfile and wiring ownership records, never a directory sweep: hand-edited files are kept unless `--force`, entries gridctl never created are never removed even with `--force`, and daemons stop before projections are touched so a live reconcile cannot re-project mid-removal. A tar.gz backup is written before anything is deleted (fail-closed: backup failure aborts the reset untouched; the purge archive lives outside the purged tree and excludes oauth tokens and daemon state on purpose). There is no restore command by design; the printed recovery path is forward (`gridctl apply`, `gridctl pack add`, `gridctl link`), with the archive as a manual fallback. `--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--verbose`, and `--format json` (versioned document) round out the surface, with exit codes 0/1/2 and idempotent re-runs. The same engine backs `POST /api/reset/preview` and `POST /api/reset`, gated to loopback peers and same-origin requests, guarded by a single-use preview-issued confirm token plus a server-enforced purge phrase, and sequenced so the result document is flushed before the serving daemon dismantles itself (#1142)

- `GRIDCTL_HOME` (and the `--home` global flag) replaces the home directory for every gridctl path: `~/.gridctl` and the client projection targets alike, so `GRIDCTL_HOME=/tmp/demo gridctl apply` runs a fully isolated instance that cannot touch real client configs, and a `reset --purge` under it is confined by construction. All path resolution funnels through one resolver with an AST-level guard test that fails the build on any stray `os.UserHomeDir` call, because a partially honored override silently writes to the real home (the allowlist keeps stack.yaml `~` expansion and `~/.docker` detection on the real home deliberately). The resolver errors instead of falling back to a relative `.gridctl`, closing a latent wrong-directory hazard on the destructive path. Daemons record their resolved home in a now-versioned state file and expose it via `/api/status`; `status` warns when the daemon on the default port belongs to a different home, state-mutating commands disclose a non-default home once on stderr, `status --json` gains a `home` field, and `doctor` reports the active home and its source (#1142)

- The pack import wizard can supply credentials, and the pack update dialog is no longer a dead end for a private pack. The backend gained pack auth separately; this is the web half. The credentials card that the skill import wizard has always had is now a shared component both wizards render rather than a copy in each, and it stays collapsed and optional: most packs are public, so leading with a credentials question would tax every import for the minority case. It opens itself, with an announced reason, when a preview fails in a way credentials could fix. The update dialog previously previewed on mount with no credentials and no input fields, so a private pack opened straight into an error with its Update button permanently disabled; a vault-backed pack now resolves there with no user input at all (the request omits the auth field, which is what makes the server re-resolve the reference it recorded at import), and a pack imported with a one-off token - which by design stores no reference - gets an inline credentials row and an explicit retry instead of a wall. Failures preserve everything the user typed and let the submit button double as retry, including an auth failure discovered at install time, which returns to the source step where the credentials live rather than restarting the wizard (#1135)

- An unreachable ssh-agent gets its own remedy in the wizard rather than a token field that cannot help. Because the daemon inherits `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` only from the shell that started it, an agent in the browser user's terminal is irrelevant, and an SSH URL cannot be authenticated with a pasted token at all - so the credentials card deliberately does **not** open for this case. Instead a distinct banner explains that the daemon has no reachable socket and offers "Try HTTPS instead", which swaps in the HTTPS URL the server derived for the same repository and opens the credentials card in vault mode: the only remedy solvable inside the browser. Restarting the daemon after starting an agent is offered as secondary text. The button appears only when the server could derive an equivalent, so a host with no HTTPS mapping does not get an action that would fail. Source-step failures now announce through the existing alert region only, not an alert plus a toast (#1135)

- Pack import accepts credentials on the CLI and the REST API, bringing packs to parity with skill import. Every pack clone previously ran with a zero-valued auth config, so a private pack repository worked only when the process happened to have inherited an ssh-agent socket or a `GITHUB_TOKEN`, with no way to supply a credential on any surface - a conspicuous gap on a path that otherwise has a full CLI verb family, a complete REST surface, and its own Library segment. `gridctl pack add` now takes `--vault-key`, `--auth-token-stdin`, `--auth-token`, and `--ssh-key`, and `POST /api/packs` and `POST /api/packs/preview` accept the same optional `auth` object the skill source endpoints take. The load-bearing half is persistence: the credential reference now reaches the importer and the pack's lockfile record, including the branch that builds that record from scratch for a wiring-only pack or a fully skipped selection, so a private pack imported with `--vault-key` records `${var:KEY}` and re-resolves on every later update instead of importing once and failing forever after. Only the reference is ever written; a literal or piped token stays transient by construction, which is why those two forms deliberately leave nothing behind. Omitting `auth` on a repository already imported with a reference resolves the stored one automatically, which is what lets an update preview a private pack with no user input, while an explicit empty object suppresses it. `pack add` also routes its failures through the same classify-hint-redact path as `skill add`; it previously printed the raw error, which meant no remediation hint and no redaction of a token embedded in the repo URL. Public pack import is unchanged in keystrokes and in what it records, and no `stack.yaml` change is involved (#1135)

- The create-server wizard's Operations Filter is now a picker instead of a blind textarea. An OpenAPI-backed server turns every operation in its spec into an MCP tool, and a large spec breaks clients outright - Cursor drops tools past roughly 40, VS Code and Copilot hard-cap at 128 - so curating that set matters, but the control took raw `operationId` values one per line and knew nothing about the spec. Operators had to already know the IDs, or deploy everything and prune afterwards. A "Load operations" button now parses the spec on demand and lists what it contains, searchable across operationId, path, summary, and tag, with method and tag filter chips. An explicit three-way mode maps 1:1 onto the config and states what happens to operations added to the spec later: All operations (no `operations` block, later additions exposed), Only selected (`include`, later additions not exposed), and All except selected (`exclude`, later additions exposed unless excluded). Rows show the raw operationId alongside the sanitized tool name, and the selection persists the raw value, which is what the filter actually matches - a list of sanitized names would silently match nothing for any spec whose IDs contain dots or spaces. Deselecting to nothing removes the filter rather than writing `include: []`, which means "expose everything" while reading as a whitelist. Selecting every operation offers, but does not force, a switch back to All, naming the trade: an enumerated list pins the server to today's spec. Operations that cannot become tools are reported with a reason rather than hidden, deprecated operations are badged, DELETE selections and specs above 50 operations draw a non-blocking advisory, and the Review step gains a one-line summary of the outcome. Loading is always explicit - editing the spec marks the list stale instead of refetching. Manual entry remains for specs that cannot be fetched while authoring, such as a path with an unexpanded variable or one that only resolves on the gateway host. No `stack.yaml` change (#1115)

- OpenAPI spec preview endpoint (backend): `POST /api/openapi/operations` parses an OpenAPI document on demand and returns every operation it contains, so the create-server wizard can show what a spec actually holds instead of asking operators to recall `operationId` values from memory. Each row carries the raw `operationId` (what `openapi.operations.include` matches) alongside the sanitized tool name (what the model sees), plus method, path, summary, tags, and a deprecated flag; the two identifiers differ whenever an ID contains characters outside `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`, and reporting only one of them would produce a filter that silently matches nothing. Operations that cannot become tools — no `operationId`, or a sanitized name that comes out empty — are returned as explicit skipped rows with a reason rather than being dropped. Enumeration is shared with the deployed tool builder so preview and deploy cannot disagree about which operations are usable. Successful parses are cached for five minutes keyed on the spec and TLS material, with the same two-tier concurrency cap the server probe uses. Spec fetching is unauthenticated, matching deploy behavior, so the request accepts a spec reference and optional TLS files and no credentials. External `$ref` resolution is disabled on this path (it stays enabled for deploy): preview is reachable from the browser against an arbitrary operator-supplied URL, so following references inside a fetched document would let a hostile spec drive further daemon-side requests. The parser rejects such a document outright rather than omitting the referencing operations, so a multi-file spec deploys normally but does not preview, and the error names `$ref` and points at manual entry. No `stack.yaml` change; the wizard UI that consumes this arrives separately (#1115)

### Fixed
- Examples that failed or silently no-oped on first use are corrected: the code-mode example drops its dead top-level `agents:` block (removed with the Agent IDE; the stack schema silently ignored it) and now describes the real ACL model, where the sandbox enforces the connecting client's allowed-tool set; the registry examples stop referencing pre-made skills that do not exist on disk, so the documented activation curls hit real skills; the autoscale example invokes the `mock-stdio-server` binary the mock-server build actually produces, via the stack-relative path its siblings use; the scoped variable-sets example drops a `port:` key the resource schema does not have; the getting-started stacks drop untagged `description:` keys that were silently ignored; and the gateway example's client URL comment now points at the real default, `http://localhost:8180/mcp`. The README hero stack moves Atlassian and Zapier from the legacy `npx mcp-remote` bridge to the shipped native OAuth shape (`url:` plus `auth.type: oauth` with `gridctl auth login`), pointing Atlassian at its current streamable HTTP endpoint (`/v1/mcp/authv2`; the `/v1/sse` URL the example previously used was retired 30 June 2026), the examples index gains the missing `declarative-link/` category and a feature matrix covering every example on disk with correct transports, the platforms docs stop framing remote OAuth endpoints and host processes as containers, and both quick starts now agree on `mcp-basic.yaml` as the first file to apply. The reference docs get the same accuracy pass: the API reference documents `POST /api/reset/preview` and `POST /api/reset` with their loopback, same-origin, and single-use confirm-token contract, corrects `replicaId` to the integer it is on the wire, replaces `${vault:}` leftovers with the canonical `${var:KEY}` form, states the real auth exemption list, and adds the `home` and `gateway.tokenizer` status fields; the CLI reference corrects `stop --force` (orphan termination only), adds the `--bind` / `--bind-all` / `--insecure-allow-unauthenticated` listen flags to `apply` and `serve`, and fills in `unlink --group`, `skill update --trust`, `pack apply --clients` (wiring-only), the doctor home / lockfile / wiring checks, and the smaller flag omissions; troubleshooting's bare `gridctl destroy` recipes now pass the required stack argument; the Node floor is corrected to 22 in the install and contributing guides; `docs/project-status.md` is stamped at `v0.1.0-rc.1` and gains reset, `GRIDCTL_HOME`, and protocol dual-stack rows; and the config schema labels `secrets:` / `${vault:}` as compatibility aliases, adds the `auth` server field row, and fixes the `mcp_servers:` typo in the scaling guide (#1145)

- The pack import wizard no longer crashes on the success screen after a successful import. Go marshals a nil slice as `null` rather than `[]`, and a clean import produces no progress notes, so the response carried `"notes": null` while the client's type declared an array — the success step called `.map` on it and the error boundary replaced the whole page with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'map')". The import had already completed at that point, so the pack was correctly in the registry and the user had no way to know it. The engine now emits `[]` for the add document's `skills` and `agents` and for `notes`, matching the types the API reference documents, and the wizard and update dialog guard every list they receive from the API. A pack whose manifest resolves to nothing was affected the same way, and would also have crashed the review step before importing anything. Populated responses serialize exactly as before (#1140)

- The ssh-agent remedy now reaches the skill import wizard and the pack update dialog, not just the pack import wizard. When a clone fails because the daemon has no reachable agent socket, credentials cannot help — a token cannot authenticate an SSH URL — so the useful response is switching to the HTTPS URL for the same repository, which the server already computes. Only one surface offered that. The skill wizard now shows the same banner with a "Try HTTPS instead" action that rewrites the URL field and opens the credentials card in vault mode. The pack update dialog, which previously opened straight into an error with its Update button permanently disabled and nothing to click, now names the cause and the HTTPS URL with a copy action; it deliberately does not switch protocol itself, because that dialog acts on the origin recorded at import and repointing it silently would change what the pack tracks. Neither surface opens the credentials card for this failure, and neither renders an action when the server could not derive an equivalent URL (#1138)

- Skill REST endpoints now send `httpsEquivalent` alongside `ssh_agent_unavailable`. `writeGitError` passed an empty repository into the structured-error writer, so the source add, check, and preview endpoints emitted the failure code without the rewritten URL that makes it actionable — leaving a client with a cause and no fix. The troubleshooting guide documented the field as arriving for skills as well as packs, so this was a contract the code did not honor (#1138)

- `gridctl pack add` accepts `--path`. `packops.AddOptions.Path` and `POST /api/packs` have both supported a subdirectory since the packs REST surface landed, but the CLI never passed it, so a pack in a subdirectory could be imported from the web UI and not from the command line. This mattered beyond a missing flag: `pack add` is the documented update verb, so re-adding a pack that had been imported with a path re-resolved against the entire repository and overwrote the pack record with a wider resource set, without warning. Note the semantics the flag pins: `--path` scopes resource discovery, it does not relocate the manifest, which is always read from the repository root (#1138)

- The variable picker is now usable by keyboard inside a modal dialog. Its dropdown renders through a portal to `document.body`, which puts it outside the enclosing dialog's focus-trap container and outside that dialog's Escape handler, so two defaults were actively wrong: Tab moved focus out of the picker and onto the dialog, making the variable list unreachable without a mouse, and Escape closed the whole dialog rather than just the picker. The popover now owns both keys itself rather than asking each consumer to opt in, which fixes it for every form that embeds it, not only the one where it was noticed. Escape closes the picker and returns focus to its trigger; Tab is left to the browser so the enclosing trap cannot treat the picker's own subtree as somewhere focus has escaped to (#1135)

- An unreachable ssh-agent is now reported as an actionable condition instead of a server fault. Cloning an SSH URL with no agent surfaced go-git's raw `SSH agent requested but SSH_AUTH_SOCK not-specified` string, which named a library the user has never heard of and no remedy, and over HTTP it fell through to a 500 - indistinguishable from the daemon being broken. The check now happens before dialing, wherever an ambient SSH clone is about to run, so both skills and packs get it: the error names the true cause (this gridctl process has no reachable socket, and a daemonized gridctl inherits one only from the shell that started it, and can outlive it), and it distinguishes an unset variable from a socket that has since gone away. Over REST it is a 422 carrying `"code": "ssh_agent_unavailable"` plus a server-computed `httpsEquivalent` for the same repository, so a client can offer the one remedy that needs no agent rather than string-matching an error message. The CLI prints the three fixes in order of reliability: retry over HTTPS with a credential (naming the rewritten URL when it can derive one), start an agent and restart the daemon so it inherits the socket, or name the key directly with `--ssh-key`. A stale socket path - the daemon outliving its agent, which is the case that actually bites - was previously not detected at all, since only the unset case was checked. Note that gridctl does not read `~/.ssh/config`, so a per-host `IdentityFile` that makes plain `git clone` work still does nothing here; that is now stated in the docs rather than left to be discovered (#1135)

- An OpenAPI server's `openapi.tls.caFile` and `openapi.tls.insecureSkipVerify` now take effect on their own. Both were applied only inside the branch that loads a client certificate, so a spec or API served with a self-signed or internally issued certificate still failed verification unless `certFile` happened to be set too - the two most common mTLS-adjacent settings were silent no-ops for the far more common case of an unauthenticated client talking to a privately signed server. A TLS config is now built whenever any of `certFile`, `caFile`, or `insecureSkipVerify` is present, with client-certificate loading still gated on `certFile`, and the transport's existing ALPN settings are preserved rather than replaced (previously configuring mTLS silently dropped HTTP/2 for that server). Anyone who set `insecureSkipVerify: true` without a client certificate was getting full verification despite asking for none; they now get what the field says (#1115)

- The OpenAPI spec preview no longer reports an unreachable host as a malformed document. A DNS failure, refused connection, TLS rejection, or timeout produces a transport error rather than the non-2xx response the classifier looked for, so all of them fell through to `parse_failed` with the hint "confirm the document is a valid OpenAPI 3.x spec" - pointing the operator at a document that was never served. These now classify as `fetch_failed` and say to check reachability from the gateway host, which is what fetches the spec. An unexpanded `${VAR}` in the spec path is also recognized ahead of the underlying failure, so a local path carrying one is named as such instead of reported as a missing file (#1115)

- The create-server wizard now writes the OpenAPI operations filter it collects. The Operations Filter control captured an include/exclude list of `operationId` values into form state, but the YAML serializer never emitted the `operations` key, so the deployed server generated a tool for every operation in the spec. Because an absent include list means "generate everything" to the backend, the loss was silent: no error, no warning, and the Review step does not display the generated YAML. The control has never worked since it was added, and shipped in every release from v0.1.0-beta.10. An empty selection still omits the key rather than emitting `include: []`, which would read as a whitelist while acting as a no-op. Note for anyone resuming a wizard draft saved before this release: drafts persist raw form state rather than generated YAML, so a stored operations list is intact and will now be applied on the next deploy, shrinking that server's tool set to what was originally selected. A shrinking tool set is deliberately not treated as schema-pin drift, so `gridctl pins verify --exit-code` and `pins diff` still exit 0; stale pin records for removed tools clear on `gridctl pins approve <server>` (#1112)

- Expert mode no longer discards a server's type on the way back to the form. Toggling the wizard's raw-YAML editor off ran a parser that returned `serverType: 'container'` for every input, which orphaned the whole `openapi`, `ssh`, or `source` block: the data survived in form state but the serializer never reached it, so deploying afterwards silently dropped the spec, auth, TLS, and operations filter. The type is now inferred from the YAML, and the parser no longer overwrites fields it cannot represent. The remaining limitation is unchanged and now stated in the editor: edits made inside expert mode to nested configuration do not carry back to the form view (#1112)

### Changed

- The skill auth flags gained a stdin form and a warning on the unsafe one, applied to `skill add`, `skill try`, and the new `pack add` together so the sibling commands cannot drift. `--auth-token <value>` puts a credential in shell history and in the process list, a documented anti-pattern (CWE-214) - GitHub's own CLI accepts tokens on stdin only. Rather than break the flag for the CI use it was added for, it stays and now prints a one-line stderr warning naming the exposure, alongside a new `--auth-token-stdin` (and the conventional `--auth-token -`) that reads the token from stdin instead, trimming the trailing newline that a token copied out of a provider UI carries. The auth hint text also lists the safer option first: it used to suggest `--auth-token` ahead of `--vault-key`, recommending the leaky form by position. The four CLI auth helpers now take an explicit writer and reader rather than reaching for `os.Stderr` and `os.Stdin`, which is what makes any of this testable; they had no unit tests before this change and now have table tests (#1135)

- The Node version used for frontend development is pinned via `.nvmrc` and an advisory `engines` field on `web/package.json`, matching the Node 22 that CI runs. The frontend test suite does not start on Node 20 (`jsdom` fails with `webidl.util.markAsUncloneable is not a function`), and on Node 23 and newer a built-in web-storage global collides with the jsdom one and fails a large share of component tests. Production builds are unaffected on newer versions; this pins the development and test environment (#1112)

## [0.1.0-rc.1] - 2026-08-10

First release candidate. Every shipped feature surface is now Stable (see [docs/project-status.md](docs/project-status.md)); the Experimental tier is retained only for features shipping dark behind the `experimental:` feature-flag registry, which currently holds none.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** the dollar-cost layer is removed from the backend, completing the staged removal begun with the web UI entry below. The gateway sits below the LLM client and cannot observe actual spend, so its dollar figures were always estimates of a fraction of a related quantity; token and usage metrics, which the gateway does measure, stay. Gone: `pkg/pricing` and the embedded LiteLLM snapshot (with the weekly refresh workflow and `task pricing:*`), the stack.yaml attribution fields (`gateway.default_model`, per-server `model:`, `client_models:`) and dollar budgets under `limits:` (rate limits stay; existing configs still load, with the removed keys ignored by the non-strict parser), the pricing and cost API routes (`GET /api/pricing/models`, the three model PUT routes, `GET`/`DELETE /api/metrics/cost`) and the `/api/status` cost and model-attribution fields, `costUsd` on `/api/tools/usage`, the `expensive_model_on_cheap_task` heuristic, the `gen_ai.cost.usd` and `gen_ai.request.model` span attributes (token and cache attributes stay), and the budget spend ledger (leftover ledger files under the state directory are orphaned and harmless). `gridctl optimize` findings now report `impact_tokens_per_week` (projected assuming ~500 prompts/week, named in the summary) instead of `impact_usd_per_week`, and `--min-impact` is token-denominated; `gridctl limits` reports rate limits only, and its budget-exceeded exit code 1 is gone. Token counting (`pkg/token`, `tokenizer:` config) is untouched (#1089)

- **Breaking (web UI):** the dollar-cost layer is removed from the web UI as the first stage of removing cost estimation entirely (the backend stage is the entry above; token and usage metrics stay). The Metrics workspace is now a token/usage surface: the Cost KPI card, cost charts, cost columns and cost-descending default sorts, the Models scope, and the priced/unpriced tool facet are gone, and a session-cumulative Format Savings card takes the fourth KPI slot. The pricing manager, effective-model tags, the command-palette pricing entry, the Stack inspector Pricing section, the wizard pricing fields (the wizard no longer emits `model:` or `default_model:`), the status-bar session-cost pill, the Traces cost pill, and dollar-budget bars are removed; the Limits panel and status-bar chip now surface rate limits only. `gridctl optimize` findings render in the UI without weekly-USD framing. Backend behavior is unchanged in this release: cost APIs still compute and serve, budgets still enforce, and stack.yaml fields still parse (#1089)

### Changed

- Every shipped feature surface graduates from Experimental to Stable ahead of the release candidate. The 27 Experimental rows in `docs/project-status.md` are now Stable, and the tier legend records that the Experimental tier is retained only for features shipping dark behind the `experimental:` feature-flag registry, which currently holds none. The flag machinery itself is untouched: the `experimental:` stack block, `GRIDCTL_EXPERIMENTAL_*` overrides, the `/api/status` `features` payload, and the status-bar chip all behave exactly as before. Three surfaces changed to make the claim honest rather than cosmetic. The pack manifest graduates to `apiVersion: gridctl.dev/v1`, with `gridctl.dev/v1alpha1` still accepted indefinitely so existing `gridctl-pack.yaml` files import unchanged (Article IX) and a wrong apiVersion now names both accepted spellings. The four agent projection targets drop their experimental tier flag, which removes the `(experimental)` suffix from `gridctl skill project status --kind agent`, the always-false `experimental` field from `GET /api/project/agents/status`, and the badge from the Library's agent projection rows. The Antigravity marker, which meant "this path rests on unofficial sourcing" rather than "this feature is unstable", is renamed accordingly: `Unofficial` in `pkg/skillsync` and `pkg/contexts`, `unofficial` on the wire in `GET /api/context` and `skill project status --format json`, and `(unofficial path)` in `ctx status`, `skill project status`, and the Global Context dialog. The `status`, `info`, and `doctor` `--json` schemas drop their "experimental until 1.0" caveat and adopt the 0.x backward-compatibility guarantee. Also removes `RuntimeInfo.IsExperimental`, dead since Podman graduated: it had no callers and always returned false

- `docs/cost-observability.md` is renamed to `docs/usage-observability.md`, matching the Usage Observability title it took when the dollar-cost layer was removed; every inbound link is updated. The feature table in `docs/project-status.md` gains a model preferences row, and the shipped `examples/registry/model-preferences.yaml` is registered in both example indexes (#1108)

### Features

- Model preference support in the Library (web UI): skills and agents now surface their model preference wherever they are listed and inspected, completing the backend entry below. A shared read-only chip renders on skill cards, Library table rows, agent cards, and both detail panels: an author declaration renders neutral, and a policy-resolved value (a stack `model_preferences` default or override) renders in the accent style with a `· policy` suffix so provenance is never ambiguous. The skill inspector gains a Model preference section and the agent Overview upgrades its raw `model` row to the typed view, both showing declared and applied values plus the per-target honor matrix (honored / ignored / unknown / dropped-on-render), so silence never reads as support. Surfacing is null-safe against older backends (no `modelPreference` object, no chip) and read-only by design: the policy stays YAML-only, matching the skills exposure-policy precedent (#1094)

- Model preference support for skills and agents (backend): the `model:` frontmatter that skill and agent authors already write is now a first-class, surfaced preference, and stacks can set defaults and overrides for it. A typed read-side view recognizes top-level `model:` and `metadata.preferred-model`/`metadata.model`, shown as a Model column in `gridctl skill list` (both kinds), in `skill project status` output as the `copy (model policy)` channel label and JSON `model_value` for rewritten projections, and as a `modelPreference` object on registry skill and agent REST responses, together with a per-target honor matrix (Claude Code honors skills inline and agents as a resolution input; the interop dir is consumer-dependent; Antigravity ignores it; rendered agent dialects drop it, as before). A new optional top-level `model_preferences:` stack block (per-scope `rewrite`/`default`/`overrides`, off by default, not inherited across `extends`, hot-reloadable) rewrites projected frontmatter on sync when opted in: the resolved preference (override beats author beats default, raising or lowering) lands in projected copies only (the registry canonical is never touched, so skill pins cannot drift from policy), and affected skill projections are forced to copy channel with the reason recorded and displayed (`copy (model policy)`). The skill lockfile gains a dual-hash model (installed vs canonical, migrating transparently) so rewritten projections report drift and staleness correctly; adopt restores policy-owned model keys to the author's declaration so they never flow back into the registry; a policy-less sync preserves rewritten projections rather than reverting the daemon's work, and `skill project sync --stack <path>` (and `status --stack`) applies a stack's policy from the CLI. `gridctl validate` gains three advisory findings (`model-preference-unknown-alias`, `model-preference-unhonored`, `model-preference-portability`); nothing enters the optimize/usage layer and no cost is claimed anywhere; this is a preference layer, unrelated to the removed cost-attribution fields (#1094)

- Pack provenance chips: pack ownership now shows wherever pack-managed resources appear, not only in the Packs segment. Agent projection status rows (`GET /api/project/agents/status`) and per-fragment context status rows (`GET /api/context`) gain an additive `pack` field carrying the applying pack's name, which the engines already recorded but never surfaced. In the web UI, a shared chip (unifying the two shipped hand copies) adds `pack: <name>` provenance to the skill inspector, skill cards, the Library table, and agent cards through the existing client-side join, and, straight from the wire, to the Connections client detail's agent projection rows (matching the Wiring section's badge) and the Global Context dialog's per-fragment status lines. Every chip is display plus a deep link to the pack detail; pack management verbs stay in the Packs segment (#1080)

- Packs REST surface: the full pack verb set is now available over HTTP, backed by a new `pkg/packops` engine extracted from the CLI (the CLI keeps its exact output and exit codes). `GET /api/packs` lists installed packs with identity, origin, per-kind counts, and attention; `GET /api/packs/{name}` adds per-resource state rows, refusing with a 409 naming both repos when two sources claim one pack name instead of picking nondeterministically. `POST /api/packs` imports from git behind the blocking security scan, and unlike the CLI it refuses the whole import with a 409 carrying the flagged resources before any write when findings lack trust; a POST against an already-imported origin is the documented update path. `POST /api/packs/preview` resolves a manifest read-only for import review; `POST /api/packs/{name}/apply` takes `clients`, `force`, and `dry_run` with full CLI flag parity; `DELETE /api/packs/{name}` supports a dry-run cascade preview and force. The pack record now persists the manifest's description and author so list views never re-clone, and `skills.lock.yaml` mutations are protected by a cross-process file lock so concurrent operations (CLI, API server, pack verbs) serialize instead of silently losing updates (#1078)

- Fragment-aware context adopt over REST: `POST /api/context/adopt/{slug}` accepts an optional body scoping the adopt in fragments mode. `{"fragment": "<name>"}` pulls one hand-edited projected file back into its source fragment on identity multi-file targets (the REST twin of `gridctl ctx adopt <client> [fragment]`), and `{"into": "<name>"}` captures a compiled target's edited body into a designated fragment, creating it when absent (the twin of `--into`). An empty body keeps the whole-client behavior. Refusals are now typed sentinels mapped to proper statuses (409 for the three adopt refusals with the engine's prose on the wire, 404 for an unknown fragment, 400 for a bad capture name) instead of a blanket 500. `GET /api/context` rows for multi-file clients gain a structured `fragments` array listing every out-of-sync fragment with its own state, so a drifted fragment can no longer hide a stale one behind the single summary string (#1076)

- Connections client health hub: the Connections workspace grows from a single-column link-toggle list into a per-client health hub. A resizable client rail (attention-first ordering with a drift filter, brand icons, link badges, the familiar inline connect toggle, and keyboard navigation) sits beside a selected-client detail pane answering "what did gridctl configure on this client, and is it still true?": collapsible sections that auto-expand on drift cover the gateway entry's full wiring ownership state with inline Re-link and Adopt (refusals render the engine's reason verbatim), global context sync with inline Sync/Unsync and a Review deep link into the Global Context dialog, agent projections with per-row render class linking into the Library (non-target clients say so explicitly instead of showing blank space), an access-scope summary deep-linking into the Tools per-client editor (`/tools?client=<slug>`), and live session activity attributed by the sessions API's new client identity. Ownership state and live connectivity render as two separately labeled axes, never one merged health light; sessions the UI cannot attribute appear in their own labeled bucket with synthesized identities, stateless-generation clients read "sessionless" rather than "0 sessions", and the status bar reads the same session array as the workspace so the two counts cannot diverge. Deep links: `?client=<slug>` selection, and the creation wizard's Client Link route now lands on a spotlighted detected-unlinked client via `?spotlight=unlinked`. The staged Review & Apply flow is unchanged and stays workspace-wide (#1074)

- Wiring ownership REST: `GET /api/project/wiring/status` exposes the full six-state ownership vocabulary (`in-sync`, `stale`, `drifted`, `target-missing`, `foreign`, `missing`) with per-row detail, remediation, and pack tag — the complete form of the fact `/api/clients` collapses into one `drifted` boolean — and `POST /api/project/wiring/adopt` wraps the take-ownership verb that was previously CLI-only, returning 409 with the engine's reason on refusal. The link endpoint's conflict message now offers the API adopt route alongside the CLI. Session entries from `GET /api/sessions` gain client identity (`clientName`, `clientVersion`, and a normalized `accessId` that matches provisioner client slugs), so sessions can be attributed to linked clients. Groundwork for the Connections client health hub (#1074)

### Fixed

- Handshake-era HTTP health checks now detect generation flips, closing the last dual-era health asymmetry. An external HTTP server that negotiated the handshake generation and redeployed as stateless-only used to read healthy forever (the health check was a bare reachability GET the flipped server still answers 200) while every tool call failed, and only a gateway restart recovered it. The handshake-era check now sends a protocol-level `ping` (stdio/process parity) and, on a method-not-found answer, confirms with a read-only `server/discover` probe before failing health, so lax legacy servers without `ping` and proxies that reject unauthenticated requests keep reading healthy exactly as before; only positive evidence of a modern peer (or transport unreachability) fails the check. The HTTP client is now reconnectable: the health monitor's existing backoff-gated reconnect path re-resolves the generation on the live client, clears the stale session, and refreshes tools before pins are re-verified, so a flipped server converges to healthy on the new generation without a restart. SSE clients, which are pinned to the handshake generation, skip flip detection entirely since re-negotiation can never move them (#1088)

- Closed the delivery gaps a post-ship audit found across the Library and Connections surfaces: `docs/project-status.md` no longer claims packs have no web UI (the Packs segment and pack REST shipped); agent projection rows in the Library now link each client row to that client in Connections, matching the reverse deep link Connections always had; the Connections Context section now lists a client's out-of-sync context fragments with their states and pack provenance chips instead of a summary line only; and the Wiring section's pack badge is now the same navigable chip the Agents rows use (#1082)

- The Global Context dialog's Review flow no longer dead-ends in fragments mode. On a multi-file client the drift dialog compared a summary string instead of file contents and its Adopt button called the whole-client endpoint, which the engine correctly refuses on multi-file targets, so every review ended in an error toast. The dialog now reviews drift per fragment with a real diff, adopts losslessly on identity renders, explains lossy renders with working alternatives instead of a dead button, and offers fragment capture on compiled targets (#1076)

- The status bar's session count and `GET /api/sessions` no longer diverge. The two surfaces read different stores with different lifecycles: the gateway's session manager is swept every 5 minutes at a 30-minute idle cutoff, while the streamable transport kept its own map that only shrank when a client sent a graceful `DELETE /mcp` — which crashed CLIs and closed tabs never do, so that count only grew (a 7 vs 21 divergence was observed on one load). The transport now defers to the gateway's manager as the single source of truth: expired sessions are excluded from listings and lazily torn down, both counts agree by construction, and a client posting on an expired session receives the spec's 404 and re-initializes cleanly instead of continuing unattributed (#1074)

- Agents in the Library workspace: the web UI's Library gains a `Skills | Agents` segmented control (URL-synced as `?kind=agent`; the retired `/agent` route now lands there), making CLI-imported agents first-class in the UI. The Agents segment shows a source-grouped catalog with per-client projection chips, an always-visible KPI strip (Total, Projected, Drifted, Experimental; deliberately no lifecycle or usage KPIs, since agents have neither), a "Sync N stale agents" pill, and an inspector with Overview (frontmatter, with `tools` and `model` called out as per-client-translated), Body, and Projection tabs. Projection rows speak the CLI's exact state vocabulary through a shared StatePill (extracted from the Global Context dialog so context and agent rows stay one color language), carry the render class and dropped-keys detail, and offer sync, unsync, and drift review inline; adopting a hand-edit is offered on the identity target with the backup named up front, while lossy render targets get the refusal spelled out with its two real alternatives as working buttons, never a disabled control with a tooltip. The single-file editor saves the whole AGENT.md byte-verbatim behind the same blocking security scan imports run, rendering findings inline on a refusal. The import wizard now discovers agents alongside skills, lists them by name in the browse and review steps (names are cheap at agent scale), and passes an explicit agent selection to the importer — which the source-add API now accepts (`selectedAgents`), since a skill selection alone deliberately skips agents (#1071)

- Agents REST surface: imported agent definitions are now manageable over HTTP, closing the "agents have no REST endpoints" limitation ahead of the Library UI. `GET /api/registry/agents` lists installed agents (bodies omitted by default, `?full=1` for complete shapes; passthrough frontmatter rides in `extra` as an ordered `{key, value}` array, never an object, because key order is part of the verbatim-projection contract), `GET /api/registry/agents/{name}` returns one agent with `body` and `raw`, `PUT /api/registry/agents/{name}` edits the file as a whole (re-parse, rename refusal, then the same blocking security scan imports run, whose findings return 409 with no trust override over REST, then a byte-verbatim atomic write, so identity projections never read an edit as manufactured drift), and `DELETE` removes the agent through the importer so origin and lock entries leave with it. A new `/api/project/agents/*` namespace exposes the projection engine: `status` (per-client rows with the shared state vocabulary plus `render: identity|lossy` and `experimental`), `sync`, `unsync` (refuses an empty request), and `adopt`, whose lossy-render refusals surface the engine's full reason as a 409 rather than a generic error. Source add and update responses already carried imported-agent detail; sync results now count refreshed agents (`importedAgents`), and the source preview response gains `agents` and `malformedAgents` so a mixed repo previews both kinds (#1071)

- Rules fragment library in the web UI: the Global Context dialog now recognizes fragments mode and swaps the single-file editor for a fragment rail in composition (filename-lexicographic) order, with add and delete affordances, a globs badge for path-scoped fragments, and the same markdown/preview split, marker validation, and sync-all flow feeding whichever fragment is selected; a dirty draft blocks fragment switching so typing is never silently discarded. The per-client strip gains a mode chip (`multi-file` / `compiled`) beside each state, and the single-file editor gains a deliberate "Fragments" affordance that names the first fragment and states the AGENTS.md-to-`fragments/00-default.md` migration before writing anything, mirroring `ctx add` (#1046)

- Rules fragment library: `gridctl ctx` can opt into a multi-file fragment store under `~/.gridctl/context/fragments/*.md` (optional `description` / `paths:` frontmatter). `ctx add <name>` activates the mode on first use by migrating AGENTS.md to `fragments/00-default.md` with a backup; read-only commands never migrate. Composition is filename-lexicographic. Multi-file passthrough targets are Claude Code, VS Code Copilot (`applyTo` from `paths:`), Cline, and Roo, each fragment file individually lockfile-owned so shared rules directories never claim user files; every other single-file target receives a compiled document with `<!-- Source: -->` attribution and the existing size-cap hard errors. Status gains a `mode` column (`single-file` / `multi-file` / `compiled`); adopt is lossless per-fragment on multi-file identity renders and refuses on compiled targets unless `--into <fragment>`. Packs activate the `rules:` manifest slot (`rules/*.md` or `fragments/*.md` in the pack repo; empty means none): rule installs pass the same blocking security scan and `--trust` gate as skills and agents, never overwrite a differing local fragment, surface a fragments-mode migration explicitly, and only pack-shipped fragments carry the pack tag, so cascade remove can never retract a user fragment. New CLI: `ctx list|add|rm`, fragment-aware `edit`/`diff`/`adopt`; REST: `/api/context/fragments` (#1046)

- Skill governance in the web UI: the Pins workspace gains a Servers | Skills toggle in its rail, extending the existing review grammar to skill-document pins: skills list drift-first under the same attention filter, and a drifted skill's detail pane shows a semantic summary line, a line-level prose diff of the canonical SKILL.md (non-printables escaped per line), the per-file added/removed/modified list, and advisory findings, with Approve bound to the reviewed diff's composite hash (a stale-content 409 reloads the diff for re-review) and a reason input required when unresolved findings exist; Reset mirrors the server flow behind the same confirm-dialog pattern. Drifted skills imported from one git source group under a source header in the rail. The Library shows one compact governance indicator per row/card only when attention is needed (pin drift, warn-or-critical findings, or a policy denial; quiet skills show nothing), the skill detail panel gains a Governance section (factual origin `Local` / `Imported: repo@ref`, pin state with a Review-in-Pins deep link, finding counts, policy verdict) plus a "Blocked by policy" chip that names the matching rule while the lifecycle badge stays untouched, and the status-bar pin badges now count skill drift and findings (server-only stacks read exactly as before), deep-linking to `/pins?kind=skill`. Skill pins ride the existing 3-second poll in their own progressive-disclosure block with rising-edge toasts (#1045)

- Skill governance pins: registry skill documents now get the same trust-on-first-use treatment tool definitions get from schema pins. The daemon silently pins every skill on first sight, recording per-file SHA-256 digests over the whole document set — the canonical `SKILL.md` (hashed on its parse-rendered form, so frontmatter normalization from imports, editor saves, and projection never manufactures false drift) plus every supporting file (dotfiles, `.origin.json`, and temp files excluded) — along with factual provenance (`local`, or `git` with repo/ref/commit from the origin sidecar). Any later content change flips the skill to "pin drift" (a distinct fact from the Library's sync drift), which persists until a human approves or resets: the daemon never auto-clears it, and the pin file lives at `~/.gridctl/pins/skills/<stack>.json`, outside the watched registry tree, so pin writes can never feed back into the disk watcher. The pins poisoning heuristics (P001–P005) now scan skill names, descriptions, and bodies via a new `ScanSkill` entry point, with findings persisted on the record as strictly advisory data — the deterministic hash is the gate, and approving a skill with unresolved findings requires a `--reason`, persisted for later reviewers. A new `gridctl skill pins list|verify|diff|approve|reset` family mirrors the `gridctl pins` contract (`--format json` with `schema_version`, exit `0`/`1`/`2`, opt-in `--fail-on-findings`, `approve --expect` bound to the reviewed diff's composite hash; distinct from `skill pin`, which pins a git source ref), backed by `/api/skill-pins` endpoints with the same 409-on-stale-hash concurrency, and registry API responses gain a `governance` object (source, origin, pin status, finding counts, policy verdict) for the upcoming Pins-workspace UI. Separately, an optional top-level `skills:` block in stack.yaml adds a global exposure policy: allow/deny name globs (deny wins, then allow, then `default:`) filtering which skills the gateway serves via prompts/resources and which projection sync places — denied skills keep their registry state and stay visible in the API flagged with the matching rule, recorded projections are skipped with a pointer rather than removed, `gridctl apply` warns for every active skill the policy hides, `gridctl validate` flags a default-deny block with no allow list, and edits hot-reload. Omitting the block preserves today's behavior exactly, and per-client skill scoping remains deferred (#1045)

- Packs: a git repo carrying a `gridctl-pack.yaml` manifest (apiVersion gridctl.dev/v1, kind: Pack) now imports and applies as one unit. `gridctl pack add <repo-url>` clones through the same origin pipeline as `skill add` (security scan, `--trust` gate) and imports exactly the manifest's selection of skills and agents — agent-level selection is new plumbing this release adds to the importer, with the legacy contract preserved: a plain skill selection still skips agents. `gridctl pack apply` projects the selection through the existing engines and, when the manifest declares `wiring: true`, ensures the gateway entry through the wiring ownership manager (skipping with a hint when no gateway is running); every projection is tagged with the pack name in the unified project lockfile, a resource tagged by a different pack is refused, and apply is additive, never transactional (`Applied N/M` summary, exit 1 on any skip). `gridctl pack status` reports the shared state vocabulary per resource plus `unresolved` rows for manifest selections the repo does not ship. `gridctl pack remove` cascades in dependency order — projections unsynced, wiring records removed through the ownership manager, then registry entries, then the pack record — keeping drifted projections with a remediation hint unless `--force` and trimming the pack record on partial removal. The import lockfile stamps schema version 2 only when a pack record exists, so setups without packs keep downgrade freedom. Manifest field names align with the Claude Code plugin.json family; the `rules:` field selects context rule fragments (see Rules fragment library). No enable/disable state, no inter-pack dependencies, no marketplace, no web UI (#1034)

- Multi-client agent renders: `gridctl skill project sync --kind agent` now projects imported agents to three rendered targets alongside the identity Claude Code copy, where those clients are detected: OpenCode (`~/.config/opencode/agents/<name>.md`, emitted as a `mode: subagent` definition), GitHub Copilot (`~/.copilot/agents/<name>.agent.md` — Copilot's global agents directory; contrary to earlier wording, Copilot does not read `~/.claude/agents`), and Gemini CLI (`~/.gemini/agents/<name>.md`). Renders are deterministic and explicitly lossy: frontmatter keys a dialect cannot express (Claude `tools` on OpenCode, and `model`, `hooks`, `mcpServers`, vendor keys everywhere) are dropped and named in sync output, `skill project status` gains a RENDER column (`identity` or `lossy`), and adopt is refused on rendered targets with a pointer at the identity projection, so client-dialect content can never flow back into the canonical store. Cursor needs no target: it reads `~/.claude/agents` natively. Hand-edited rendered files still report drifted and are never overwritten without `--force`, including by the daemon reconcile (#1034)

- Wiring ownership: `gridctl link` and `unlink` now record what they write instead of guessing what they wrote. Every link stores the client, config path, entry name, and an RFC 8785 canonical hash of the written value in the unified project lockfile (`~/.gridctl/project.lock.yaml`, hash only, never the value, since entries can carry secrets in env blocks; a short hash history means a gridctl upgrade changing its own written shape never reads as user drift). Unlink deletes an entry only when its current value is one gridctl recorded (or `--force`, which unlink now accepts for hand-edited entries); entries gridctl never wrote are never deleted, with or without force, closing the long-standing hazard where a user's own localhost entry could be removed by name match. A pre-existing entry identical to what gridctl would write is adopted silently; anything else foreign is refused with an adopt hint, and the old localhost/npx shape heuristic now serves only that one-time migration hint. The new `gridctl project` verb family (`sync|status|unsync|adopt --kind wiring`, with `--format json` and exit codes `0`/`1`/`2`) exposes the state matrix: `in-sync`, `stale` (gateway port or entry shape changed), `drifted`, `target-missing` (distinguishing a removed key from a wiped config file, the failure mode first-party clients have shipped), `foreign`, and `missing`. Every link surface records ownership identically (CLI, `apply --flash`, the stack `link:` reconcile during apply, and the web UI, whose Connections workspace gains a Drifted badge), `gridctl doctor` gains advisory per-client wiring rows ("detected but not linked", drift), and the daemon never auto-reconciles wiring. Existing links predate the lockfile and show as `foreign` until relinked or adopted once (#1031)

- Agent resource kind: `gridctl skill add <repo-url>` now also discovers Claude Code subagent definitions matching the `agents/*.md` convention (at the repo root or any subdirectory root, the plugin-shaped layout), so a repo shipping `skills/` plus `agents/` imports as a unit. Each agent lands verbatim at `~/.gridctl/registry/agents/<name>/AGENT.md` with the same `.origin.json` sidecar, security scan (`--trust` gate covers bodies and frontmatter values), lockfile tracking, and drift-safe `skill update` semantics skills get; agent names are validated (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; no colons, which Claude Code refuses) and duplicate names within a batch fail those items with an error naming both sources. `gridctl skill project sync --kind agent` projects every imported agent to `~/.claude/agents/<name>.md` as a single copied file with dedicated-file ownership: a pre-existing hand-authored file is refused without `--force` and backed up under `~/.gridctl/project-backups/agent/` with it, a hand-edited projection reports drifted, and `adopt --kind agent` pulls the edit back into the canonical store instead. `skill project status` gains agent rows (marked experimental), every row in `skill project` JSON output now carries a `kind` field, `skill list`/`remove`/`info` take `--kind agent`, and the daemon reconciles agent projections alongside skills. The import lockfile (`~/.gridctl/skills.lock.yaml`) gains a schema `version` field with a newer-version guard; version-less files migrate on read. Claude Code is the only render target in this slice (identity render; Cursor also reads `~/.claude/agents` natively), and there is no web UI surface yet (agents are CLI-only for now) (#1020)

- MCP protocol generation in the web UI: mixed-generation fleets show a Generation row in the Stack canvas sidebar next to the existing Protocol row (suppressed when every server speaks the same generation, since a uniform label carries no signal), and the Connections workspace gains a read-only Live sessions card listing each active session with its negotiated protocol version and generation. The card is deliberately separate from the client rows above it: those are declared links (config-file state), while sessions are transport state, and stateless-generation clients (2026-07-28) are sessionless by design and never appear there (#1018)

- MCP transport dual-stack: the gateway now speaks both protocol generations concurrently, per peer, in both directions: the handshake era (2025-11-25 and earlier: `initialize`, `Mcp-Session-Id` sessions) and the new stateless era (2026-07-28: per-request `_meta`, `server/discover`, MRTR). Downstream, each server's generation is auto-negotiated by probing `server/discover` and falling back to the legacy handshake on anything not positively modern (auth challenges and probe 5xx reject outright rather than misclassifying); the verdict is re-derived on reconnect and restart, and an optional per-server `protocol_generation: auto | handshake | stateless` knob pins mis-probing peers. Upstream, `POST /mcp` (and group endpoints) accepts stateless requests with no session, implements `server/discover`, validates the mirrored `Mcp-Method`/`Mcp-Name` headers (base64 sentinel decoding included) with the spec's `-32020`/`-32021`/`-32022` error codes, and derives per-request identity from `_meta` clientInfo so access scoping, budgets, telemetry, and tracing behave identically on both paths. Results are bridged between generations: `resultType` is synthesized for legacy servers, `ttlMs`/`cacheScope` aggregate as min-across-fleet (zero when any server is legacy) and private-unless-all-public, and MRTR `requestState` relays byte-exact through a routing envelope that survives gateway tool renaming, with retries never cached. Cross-generation MRTR is deliberately out of scope and reports a clear error. The tasks extension proxies opaquely when exactly one stateless server declares it. `listChanged` is no longer advertised on any generation (gridctl never emitted the notification; advertising it was a conformance violation). Generation is visible in `gridctl status --json`, `/api/mcp-servers` (`protocolGeneration`), `/api/sessions` (`entries` with per-session tags), a `gridctl doctor` per-server check, a negotiation-time log line, and an `mcp.protocol.generation` trace attribute. Schema-pin fingerprints are untouched by design (the new result fields live outside tool definitions), so a fleet changing generations shows zero pin drift. The official `@modelcontextprotocol/conformance` suite is wired into `tests/integration/` with a checked-in expected-failures baseline and a `task test:conformance` task (#1018)

- Experimental feature flags: a new optional top-level `experimental:` block in stack.yaml enables registered experimental flags by name, backed by a typed registry (`pkg/flags`) with lifecycle stages (experimental, graduated, removed) and a graduation-deadline test so flags cannot rot silently. Everything defaults to off, so an unchanged stack.yaml behaves identically. Unknown flag names warn at `gridctl apply` and `gridctl validate` listing the valid names, and graduated or removed names warn with a specific migration message — never an error, so a stack written against a newer gridctl still deploys. Each flag can be overridden per process with `GRIDCTL_EXPERIMENTAL_<NAME>` (strconv.ParseBool vocabulary; unset defers to YAML, unparseable warns). Enabled flags surface in `GET /api/status` (`features` plus `feature_details`), `gridctl status --json`, and the web UI as a read-only "N experimental" status-bar chip with per-flag rows in the spec pane; flags are configured in stack.yaml only and cannot be toggled from the UI. Edits to the block hot-reload without container restarts. The first registered flag, `transport_dual_stack`, was reserved for the MCP transport work. The flag lifecycle is documented in CONTRIBUTING.md, and `GRIDCTL_NO_SKILL_UPDATE_CHECK` now accepts the same boolean vocabulary (previously only `"1"`) (#1021)

- `gridctl skill project adopt <skill> --client <slug>`: a hand-edited copy projection (Antigravity's forced copies, or `--copy` elsewhere) can now be pulled back into the registry skill instead of being clobbered by `--force`. Adopt backs up the registry's `SKILL.md` as `SKILL.md.pre-<sha>` (the same convention forced updates use), writes the changed files back, and re-syncs that one (skill, client) pair to in-sync; other clients projecting the skill go stale until the next sync. The adopted content counts as local edits, so `gridctl skill update` refuses to overwrite it without `--force`. Symlinked projections are refused (the registry copy is the source of truth), as are empty or invalid projected files. Exit codes follow the family convention: `0` adopted, `1` nothing to adopt, `2` infrastructure (#1019)

### Changed

- On the stateless generation, the gateway-owned skill surfaces (`prompts/list`, `resources/list`, `resources/templates/list`, and `resources/read`) now carry their own cache metadata (`ttlMs` 60000, private) instead of the downstream tool fleet's aggregate. Skills are served from the local registry, so their cache lifetime is unrelated to the tool fleet: previously one legacy tool server in the stack pinned every skill list and read to uncacheable. `tools/list` and `server/discover` keep the fleet aggregate, which is the surface it actually describes (post-dual-stack audit follow-up)

- The `transport_dual_stack` experimental flag has graduated: the MCP transport dual-stack shipped unconditionally, the flag never gated anything, and its registry entry now says so. A stack.yaml still setting `experimental: transport_dual_stack` deploys unchanged and warns with a migration message pointing at the `protocol_generation` per-server knob. The integration conformance harness now pins `@modelcontextprotocol/conformance` 0.2.0-alpha.10 and exercises the 2026-07-28 generation for real: the default active suite runs under `--spec-version 2026-07-28` (the previous pin's stateless scenarios lived under an empty `draft` set, so the modern surface had no third-party validation), and the 20 stateless-only scenarios the suite has not yet promoted (SEP-2575 `_meta` validation, SEP-2549 caching, SEP-2243 headers, MRTR) run individually. Expected-failures baselines are now per generation (the suite runs strict with a baseline, and a few multi-version scenarios fail on exactly one generation) (#1084)

- `gridctl pack status` rule rows now report per-client projection state once a pack is applied (in-sync, stale, drifted, or target-missing per client), instead of only store-level presence. Coverage is per fragment-file projection: multi-file clients get one row per client, while a compiled client's whole-document state stays in `gridctl ctx status`. A rule that was imported but never projected keeps its store-presence row, and a missing rule still reports `missing` with the re-run hint. Multi-pack output is now sorted by pack name, and a pack name claimed by two imported sources now refuses `pack status <name>`, `pack apply`, and `pack remove` with both repos named (exit 2) instead of acting on a nondeterministic pick (#1078)

- Projection state now lives in one unified lockfile, `~/.gridctl/project.lock.yaml`, shared by `gridctl ctx` and `gridctl skill project` and owned by the new `pkg/project` engine. The lockfile is keyed by destination path, so one destination can never have two owners, and versioned in two tiers: a breaking `version` readers refuse when newer, and an additive `revision` whose unknown fields survive rewrites and re-syncs by older binaries of the same version. Legacy `skillsync.lock.yaml` and `context.lock.yaml` files migrate automatically on the first sync after upgrading: both are backed up to `~/.gridctl/project-migration-backup/<timestamp>/`, then replaced with version-2 tombstones so a downgraded gridctl fails loudly ("written by a newer gridctl version") instead of silently diverging; restore the backup if you downgrade deliberately. Context operations now hold the same cross-process lock skill projections always had, closing a CLI-vs-daemon race. `gridctl doctor` gains a `project.lockfile` check reporting which generation is in use, and CLI behavior is otherwise byte-identical, enforced by characterization tests (#1019)

- Code mode is now a stable feature: the `gateway.code_mode` and `gateway.code_mode_timeout` settings and the `--code-mode` flag are no longer labeled experimental. Behavior is unchanged (#1021)

- The project task runner is now Task (https://taskfile.dev): `task build`, `task test`, `task lint`, and friends replace the Makefile targets, with namespaced names for grouped work (`build:web`, `test:integration`, `pricing:update`, `mock:servers`). Run `task --list` for the catalog. A transitional Makefile shim keeps every old `make <target>` name working while muscle memory catches up. `task test` and `task test:integration` now run with the race detector to match CI, `task lint` covers both golangci-lint and the frontend lint, a failed frontend build now fails `task build:web` instead of silently staging stale assets, and the `gridctl validate` hint for unknown pricing models points at `task pricing:update` (#1014)

### Bug Fixes

- A downstream server that changes protocol generation between connections now re-negotiates cleanly and surfaces through the health channel. Two defects fixed (#1086): the era re-probe no longer carries the previously negotiated `MCP-Protocol-Version` header (which contradicted the probe's `_meta` and made strict stateless servers reject the probe with `-32020` instead of answering, wedging registration after a generation flip), and the HTTP transport's health check on the stateless generation now exercises `server/discover` like the stdio and process transports do, instead of a bare reachability GET, so a mid-session generation flip fails into the health/degraded channel rather than surfacing as per-call tool errors. All three transports additionally validate the discover answer itself (resultType complete, a mutually supported stateless version), so a lax peer answering junk to unknown methods can no longer read healthy while every real call fails

- Tool calls on stdio and process transports with tracing active no longer risk corrupting large integer arguments. The trace-context `_meta` injection decoded params through `map[string]any`, converting every number to float64 on the way through, so integers beyond 53 bits (IDs, timestamps in nanoseconds) could be silently rounded on both protocol generations whenever a span was sampled. The merge now passes every byte outside the injected trace keys through untouched

- Running the official 2026-07-28 conformance scenarios against the stateless edge surfaced five wire deviations, all fixed. A request whose `MCP-Protocol-Version` header declares the stateless generation but whose `_meta` is missing or incomplete is now rejected with `-32602` at HTTP 400 naming the missing piece (SEP-2575); previously a `_meta`-less modern request fell through to session lookup and answered "Mcp-Session-Id header required", and `server/discover` answered incomplete probes leniently (a compliant modern prober always stamps full `_meta`, so the leniency only masked non-compliant callers; a missing `clientCapabilities` also returned `-32600` instead of `-32602`). A header/`_meta` protocol-version disagreement now returns `-32020` HeaderMismatch even when one side is also unsupported (`-32022` is reserved for the agreeing-but-unsupported case). `resources/templates/list` is implemented on both generations (an empty list with caching hints, since the gateway exposes no templated resources; it previously answered `-32601` despite the advertised resources capability, which SEP-2549 flags). An empty `tools/list` now marshals `"tools": []` instead of `null`, which conformance clients read as a failed call. On the stateless path, calling a tool no server provides returns the spec's `-32602` "Unknown tool" protocol error instead of an executed-with-error result, and `resources/read` failures always use `-32602` with the requested URI in the error data (SEP-2164); handshake-era responses for both are unchanged (#1084)

- `gridctl link continue` now writes a key Continue actually reads. The entry went to `experimental.mcpServers`, but Continue's `config.json` schema defines `experimental.modelContextProtocolServers` — and because the schema does not restrict additional properties, the wrong key was accepted and silently ignored. Linking reported success and the gateway never appeared in Continue. The transport shape was already correct (`{"transport": {"type": "streamable-http", "url": …}}` matches the schema's streamable-http variant), so only the key name was wrong. Reads consult both keys so an entry written before the correction is still discoverable, `unlink` clears both, and an emptied list now removes the key instead of leaving `"mcpServers": null` behind. **Existing Continue links need one migration:** the entry is inert today, so run `gridctl link continue` (adopts and records ownership), then `gridctl unlink continue`, then `gridctl link continue` — or delete the `experimental.mcpServers` block from `~/.continue/config.json` and link once. A plain relink reports "already had a matching entry" without rewriting, because ownership adoption compares the entry value and cannot see that the key differs (#1066)

- **Behavior change:** gridctl now refuses to start when the bind is widened past loopback with no `gateway.auth` configured, where it previously logged a warning and served anyway. Enforcement is keyed to the user's own act of widening the bind, following Elasticsearch's bootstrap checks: a loopback gateway — the default since the previous release — stays permissive and silent, and only a deliberately network-reachable one is gated, so the common path gains no friction. The refusal names every way forward rather than stating the refusal alone (configure `gateway.auth`, return to a loopback bind, or set the override), since a bare failure reads as gridctl being broken and the user cannot guess which of three unrelated settings is responsible. The override is `--insecure-allow-unauthenticated` plus a matching `gateway.insecure_allow_unauthenticated` field; both exist because a flag can be dropped by whatever wraps the process, and it warns on every start rather than going quiet once set. `examples/gateways/gateway-remote.yaml` widens the bind and now carries the required `auth` block. Authentication remains optional on loopback: requiring it there would break every CLI subcommand that calls the local API for no security gain (#1060)

- `gridctl pack add` can now update a pack rule whose content changed upstream. Rule fragments recorded only their names in the import lockfile, with no per-rule content hash, so the installer's only available check was comparing incoming bytes against whatever was on disk — which cannot tell "the pack changed this rule" apart from "the user edited it." Both were refused identically, meaning the documented update path (re-run `pack add`) worked for rules that never changed and failed for exactly the ones that did. `LockedPack` now carries per-rule provenance (upstream path and content hash, mirroring how skills and agents are already recorded in the same file), and the installer distinguishes three cases: unchanged, changed upstream with no local edit (updated, and reported as such), and locally modified (skipped, now saying so). Lockfiles written before this load unchanged, with their rules treated as unknown provenance and handled exactly as before until their next `pack add`. Separately, `foreignPackTags` did not consider context fragments, so the cross-pack ownership refusal documented for packs was not enforced for rules; it is now (#1061)

- **Behavior change:** gridctl now binds `127.0.0.1` instead of every interface, and DNS rebinding protection covers the whole HTTP surface rather than only `/mcp`. The listen address was built as `fmt.Sprintf(":%d", port)`, which has no host part and so bound `0.0.0.0` and `::` — putting roughly 90 REST routes, `/sse`, and the web UI on the local network with no authentication, including a variables endpoint that returns secrets in plaintext when the vault is unlocked. It also meant any container gridctl launches could reach the gateway through its `host-gateway` alias. Three defaults here contravened Article XII and XIII of the constitution. Loopback is now the default; `--bind <addr>`, `--bind-all`, and a `gateway.bind` field opt back in, with the flags taking precedence, and a startup warning fires when the bind is non-loopback with no `gateway.auth` configured. The Host check added for `/mcp` last release now runs as mux-wide middleware sharing one implementation, with `/health` and `/ready` exempt so the daemon parent can still poll them. Downstream container ports are published on the same address rather than a hardcoded `0.0.0.0`. Remote access is still supported — see `examples/gateways/gateway-remote.yaml`, which now opts in explicitly — and SSH forwarding remains the recommended path for single-machine access. Authentication stays opt-in for now; making it mandatory on a widened bind is tracked separately (#1058)

- The MCP endpoint now validates the `Host` header, closing the DNS rebinding gap on `/mcp`. `validateOrigin` checked only `Origin`, which browsers omit entirely on same-origin GET and HEAD requests — and after a DNS rebind the attacker's page *is* same-origin from the browser's point of view, so there was nothing to validate. `Host` is the value a browser must set to the attacker's domain and that page scripts cannot override, which is why it is the primary control (Origin remains as defense in depth). Requests arriving over loopback whose `Host` is not a loopback name are now rejected with 403; applicability is decided from the address the request actually arrived on rather than the configured bind address, so loopback clients stay guarded even when the daemon listens on `0.0.0.0`, while deliberately network-exposed deployments keep working. Loopback names must also match the listener's port, and lookalikes such as `127.0.0.1.evil.com` or `0.0.0.0` are rejected. A new optional `gateway.allowed_hosts` accepts extra Host values for reverse-proxy and container deployments; unset means loopback-only, and wildcards are deliberately not supported. This clears the MCP conformance suite's `localhost-host-rebinding-rejected` check, whose failure had been carried as an expected-failure baseline entry. Scope: this covers the MCP endpoint for loopback-arriving connections. The REST API and `/sse` remain ungated, and gridctl still binds all interfaces by default with authentication off unless configured — that default-exposure posture is tracked separately and is the larger remaining issue (#1056)

- Every remaining hardcoded amber class in the web UI now resolves through the theme system. Sixty-eight raw `amber-*` Tailwind classes across 22 files styled warning notices, draft and drift badges, the vault secret marker, and the variable type badges; raw palette classes do not re-key per theme, so all of them were tuned against the dark theme alone and rendered at roughly 1.2:1 in light. They now use semantic tokens: genuinely actionable states (the runtime-failure notice, context drift, telemetry disabled, unencrypted secrets, sync-overwrite warnings) map to `status-pending`, lifecycle and drift badges to the same family, and the vault secret marker is neutral since its `Lock` and `Eye` icons already carry the distinction. The registry lifecycle color map, which existed in three divergent copies across the state badge, the Stack canvas node, and the Library KPI legend, is now defined once. An ESLint rule fails the build on raw `amber-*` and `yellow-*` classes so the convention documented in the components README is enforced rather than merely written down; it catches literals inside `cn()` composition and template literals, and exempts the chart palette and tests (#1053)

- The light theme's "running" status color no longer fails contrast as text. `--color-status-running` was emerald-600, which measured 3.33:1 for small text on its own tinted background, so the active-state badge could not reach the WCAG AA 4.5:1 threshold once it stopped using a raw palette class. It re-keys to emerald-800 for light only, reaching 5.22:1. Solid uses are all indicator dots with no text on them, so they only gain contrast, and the dark theme value is unchanged (#1053)

- The light theme's warm accent is now legible. Its primary and pending tokens shared the single hex `#b45309`, which fell below the WCAG AA 4.5:1 threshold as small text on the theme's warm-tinted surfaces: the active workspace tab measured 3.96:1 on every route, the Library KPI tiles 3.84:1, and solid primary buttons 4.32:1. The Library's "Sync sources (N updates)" pill was worse at 1.21:1, effectively invisible, because it hardcoded a raw `amber-300` class that bypasses the theme system and had only ever been checked against the dark theme. Light-theme primary re-keys to `#92400e` with its light and dark ramp steps moving alongside it, so gradients keep a visible step and button hovers stay perceptible, and pending re-keys to `#854d0e` so "brand accent" and "needs attention" stop being the same color in light mode (a collision the dark theme never had). Both Sync-sources affordances move onto brand tokens rather than the warning family, matching the sidebar's existing "N updates" pill: an available update is informational and optional, not a warning. The dark theme is unchanged (#1053)

- `gridctl link` now writes streamable-HTTP `/mcp` endpoints for every client; legacy HTTP+SSE `/sse` shapes are no longer written anywhere (they are removal-eligible upstream as of 2026-08-18). Cursor, Windsurf, and Zed entries move from `/sse` URLs to `/mcp` (Zed's HTTP transport is streamable-only, so its old entries never connected on current Zed), VS Code moves from `"type": "sse"` to `"type": "http"`, Goose from `type: sse` to `type: streamable_http`, AnythingLLM from `"sse"` to `"streamable"`, Continue from `"sse"` to `"streamable-http"`, and Roo Code drops the `transportType` key its current schema rejects in favor of the required `"type": "streamable-http"`. Existing `/sse` entries are still recognized as gridctl's own and update in place on the next `gridctl link` (or `link --all`) without `--force`; nothing is migrated behind your back. The Connections transport label now reads "native HTTP" for every non-bridge client (#1031)

- The background skill-projection reconcile no longer trusts an empty registry. The registry store reads a missing or unreadable registry directory as "no skills", and the daemon's post-refresh reconcile treated every projection as orphaned in that state: it deleted the projected entries from client skill directories and rewrote the projection lockfile empty, silently. Reconcile now refuses to remove anything when the store reports zero active skills while projections are recorded, logging a warning instead; explicit `gridctl skill project sync` and `unsync` retain full authority, so deliberately clearing the registry still has a supported cleanup path. The same hardening reaches the test suite, which could previously trigger this exact removal against a developer's real home directory: the reconcile home is now injected at the controller boundary, saved-stack API handlers and the pin store honor injected paths for every write, and each package whose tests can reach home-resolving code sandboxes `HOME` for the whole test run (#1023)

- Skill import no longer strips frontmatter keys it does not model. The registry parser decoded SKILL.md frontmatter into a fixed set of fields and re-emitted only those, so client extensions like `argument-hint`, `disable-model-invocation`, `hooks`, and `model` silently vanished from every imported copy, from re-syncs, from renames, and from web editor saves. Unknown keys are now captured into an `extra` field, preserved verbatim through parse, render, the JSON API, and the editor's save path (values exact; ordering may normalize), and never interpreted by gridctl. Registries written before the fix heal on their next `gridctl skill update`, which re-imports the upstream file with the keys intact (#1009)

- `gridctl skill add` and `gridctl skill update` now actually install upstream changes. The per-repo clone cache under `~/.gridctl/cache/repos/` was fetched on every run but the fetched commits never reached the checked-out worktree, so unpinned sources reported "already up to date" forever while branch-pinned sources reported "update available" on every run and reinstalled the same stale content. Updates now land the worktree on the freshly fetched remote-tracking tip for every ref shape (unpinned default branch, branch names, tags, and semver constraints, whose new matching tags were previously never detected), falling back to a fresh shallow clone when the fetched objects are incomplete. Cache mutations are serialized per repository, and offline behavior is unchanged: a failed fetch still degrades to the cached content with a warning. No manual cache clearing is needed after upgrading; the first `skill update` installs correctly. One exception: a skill whose upstream version was reviewed and skipped as locally-edited during a web sync recorded that version as seen, so it needs one `gridctl skill update --force <name>` to install it (#1010)

## [0.1.0-beta.15] - 2026-07-28


### Features

- Library workspace next wave, five additions. An **Import** action in the Library header opens the skill import wizard directly, so adding a git source no longer routes through the generic Create Resource flow (the registry sidebar already had this entry point; the workspace did not). The inspector warns when a skill's instructions reference `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` paths that ship no installed files, which is the silent failure mode for packages imported before supporting-file install landed: the agent follows a step that invokes a file which is not on disk. The warning names only the directories actually absent, offers a one-click sync for a git-owned skill, and keys on path shape rather than prose, so a body that merely says "run the build scripts" does not trip it; it also stays silent while the file list is unknown, since absence of data is not evidence of a broken package. A **Stale** usage facet joins Never used, counting active skills whose last call falls outside a selected lookback window, with the 24-hour, seven-day, and 30-day vocabulary shared with Tools Audit rather than forked, round-tripping through `?window=`. It follows the same nullable-count contract as Never used and adds a second unknowability condition beyond the cold-window gate: a 30-day question cannot be answered by three days of tracking, so the card renders a dash, goes inert, and suggests a shorter window. A **Select mode** toggle pins the multi-select checkboxes visible instead of revealing them on hover, persisted alongside the compact-rows preference; any live selection still implies it, so the toggle is a discoverability aid rather than a gate. Finally, the inspector's Modified chip becomes a named button that opens the same upstream diff the editor's Compare action uses. The selected skill's instructions now load once per selection rather than on Instructions-tab open, since the package check needs them too; one request serves both, and the tab opens without a spinner

- Least-privilege secret injection and Variables workspace trust: a `secrets.sets` entry can now be written as a mapping that names the workloads it reaches (`- name: github-creds` with `servers:` and/or `resources:`), so a set injects only where it is needed instead of into every MCP server and resource. Scoping is opt-in per entry and an entry left as a bare set name keeps the original fan-out, so existing stacks are unaffected; unscoped entries also survive a load and save cycle as bare names rather than being rewritten as mappings. Naming a server or resource the stack does not declare is now a validation error, as is listing a scoped set more than once (repeated entries inject the union of their scopes, so a bare entry beside a scoped one silently widens it back to a fan-out; repeating a bare name stays valid, since that was accepted before scoping existed and is idempotent), and the previously unvalidated `secrets:` block is checked for the first time. Scoping mistakes fail closed rather than widening access: a misspelled key (`server:` for `servers:`) is rejected outright instead of being silently dropped and leaving the entry unscoped, and an explicitly empty scope means no workloads rather than all of them, reported as an error since a set that injects nowhere is an unfinished edit. The usage index tracks scoping in lockstep: a scoped set contributes one consumer per receiving workload (carrying `target` and `targetKind` alongside the unchanged set `name`), those rows are clickable through to the Stack canvas node, and several targets of one set fold into a single expandable row rather than repeating. The Variables workspace gains a drift banner naming stack references that no stored variable satisfies, with a Create action that seeds the import preview with the missing keys, turning an apply-time `missing variable(s)` failure into an authoring-time warning; references carrying a default (`${var:KEY:-fallback}`) are valid config and never reported, and a locked vault reports nothing rather than flagging everything. Three single-select chips (Explicit refs / Set-injected / Not referenced, with counts over the whole vault) narrow the list and round-trip through `?ref=`, disabling themselves when the usage index is unknown so a failed fetch never reads as "nothing is referenced". The import preview gains a "Skip all conflicts" toggle so a bulk import can avoid every overwrite in one click, and the inspector shows when each value last changed. New endpoint `GET /api/var/drift` (canonical path only, never mirrored onto the deprecated `/api/vault` surface)

- Tools workspace next wave: with Audit on, filter chips (All / Used / Unused / Disabled, with per-state counts) narrow the list, and a Destructive risk chip (available regardless of Audit) narrows to tools whose server reports `destructiveHint: true`; a sort control orders by name, most recent use, call count, or estimated cost (picking a usage sort loads the usage snapshot even with Audit off; the default keeps server-advertised order and an active search keeps relevance order). Facets round-trip through `?filter=`, `?sort=`, and `?risk=` and persist across sessions (URL wins). Rows and the detail rail surface MCP tool annotations: compact chips for declared hints and a Hints section that spells them out with the spec-mandated "reported by the server, not verified" framing (unannotated tools state the pessimistic default instead of a blank). Fleet actions gain "Disable unused" plus a hand-picked multi-server scope: the plan derives from the audit window's usage, previews exact per-server tool lists with the `observedSince` caveat, refuses any server whose whitelist would empty (an empty whitelist means expose-all), and applies atomically with one reload. The header shows "Optimize suggests N unused tools (7d)" with a jump into Audit whenever the optimize `unused_tool` heuristic has findings (never rendering "0" on a young gateway). The Access modal gains the per-server tool axis from the Stack Access Lens (All / Custom checklists sharing the same flatten/seed state model, empty-Custom saves blocked, untouched axis preserved on save). `GET /api/tools/catalog?include=all` serves the pre-whitelist inventory so disabled tools keep descriptions, schemas, and annotations in the UI; the parameterless response is unchanged. The dirty server's rail badge shows the draft count while editing, the center column widens to `max-w-4xl`, and a user guide lands at `docs/tools-workspace.md`

- Metrics drill-down, Overview home, and optimize handshake: selecting a server now refocuses the center charts on that server's token and cost series with the fleet as a dashed context line, a focused-share line under the KPI cards ("atlassian: 12k tokens · $0.42 · 34% of window"), entity-named chart titles and aria summaries, and a "Focused" chip that clears back to the fleet view; clients focus the cost chart only (no per-client token series exists — the gap is stated, never papered over), tools keep fleet charts with an honest note, and an entity with no samples in the window keeps fleet charts plus a note instead of a fabricated flat line. Overview becomes a real home: Top Servers and Top Tools previews (five rows, cost-ranked, row click or View all jumps into the scope) and a "Savings opportunities" card showing the top optimize findings by weekly impact with severity chips — a finding click deep-links to the affected server or server-qualified tool row, and an info-only report collapses to one quiet line. The sidebar's Optimize section and the savings card now share one polling implementation and cadence. The Models scope earns its keep with a Model Breakdown table (share, cost, entities using the model, provenance mix) derived from the same single-tier aggregation as the mix bars so the two can never disagree. The Tools scope gains a search input (`/` focuses it), server facet chips, and a priced/unpriced facet — URL-synced as `?q=`/`?server=`/`?priced=`, driving keyboard navigation from the filtered list, with a result count and a distinct filtered-empty state. The center column widens for chart legibility, and stack servers with no recorded traffic now appear in the Per-Server breakdown as zero rows (with unknown cost as an em dash) so an unused server is selectable rather than absent

- Pins review actions and findings ergonomics: the drift panel gains copy (the full `live_server_hash` for `gridctl pins approve --expect`), export (the rendered diff as JSON for audit), and re-verify (read-only recompute; also available on clean servers) actions, and approving five or more changes or any drift carrying warn-or-critical findings now interposes a confirmation that restates the change counts and findings before re-pinning (small clean drifts stay one click). Resetting a server's pins moves into the UI behind a clearly separated danger action with a blast-radius confirmation naming the server and consequences. In the pinned-records table, findings collapse behind their summary badges (click to expand) and a Findings-only toggle filters to flagged tools with a visible count; `?view=findings` deep links land with the filter active, and the choice persists. Full hashes appear on hover wherever shortened hashes render, and the command palette gains a Pins section (approve, re-verify, export, copy hash, filters, and reset), scoped to the workspace

- Pins review core: drift review is faster to read and land on. Changed descriptions render a word-level diff (removed tokens tinted on the old row, added tokens on the new row, every token still escaped) instead of two paragraphs to eye-diff, backed by a shared dependency-free diff module; the review column widens while a drifted server is selected, and on wide panes each drifted tool splits into review prose on the left and its schema panels on the right, so JSON walls no longer interrupt the reading flow (stacked as before on narrow panes). Every schema panel gains an expand button opening a full-viewport overlay with line numbers, add/remove counts, and soft-wrapped long lines, so property descriptions wider than the inline column (over half of real pinned schemas) are readable without dragging a horizontal scrollbar; pins recorded before schema capture open a single-pane viewer of the new schema instead of a comparison against nothing The rail gains an attention-only filter (on by default whenever any server has drift or warn-or-critical findings; the explicit choice persists) with an all-clear state, and rows carry the tool count and last-verified age; Enter moves focus from the rail to the Approve button. Deep links gain section targeting via `?view=drift|findings|tools`: the status-bar chips, the drift and findings toasts, and the Stack canvas drift annotation (now a link) all land on the affected server with the relevant section scrolled into view. Also fixes the "pinned before schema capture" panel rendering pretty-printed schemas as one line of literal `\n` sequences

- Resizable Traces workspace layout: the trace list and waterfall now share a draggable, persisted split (list collapsible to zero via the separator or a new `[` shortcut that keeps the selected trace and URL intact), and span detail moves from a fixed right column to a height-resizable bottom drawer under the waterfall, so opening attributes no longer steals timeline width; the drawer height persists separately and its sections reflow into columns at drawer widths. The span-name column in the waterfall gains its own drag handle (18–45%, persisted), Escape now closes the span drawer first and the waterfall second, double-clicking any panel separator resets that split, and the list's Client/Server/Spans/copy columns now drop based on actual list width instead of selection state. Separators match the grip style, keyboard resize, and layout persistence of the Logs and Metrics workspaces, in both the main window and the detached popout

- MCP-native Logs workspace: the shared log surface gains click-to-filter source badges with a removable `source:` chip, a one-click Errors toggle that remembers and restores the previous level selection (round-tripping the `level=none` sentinel), search that also matches structured attr values with match spans highlighted in the message, and an expand panel rebuilt around promoted MCP fields (tool, server, client, replica, duration, error) with copy message, copy raw, and copy trace ID actions, a full-width trace chip that pivots to the waterfall, and the remaining attrs collapsed under "Other attributes". Tool-call log lines now carry the calling `client` in attrs (omitted when no client identity is on the context), and `GET /api/logs` serves a `{logs, total, bufferCapacity}` envelope so the view can label its window honestly against the ring (`docs/api-reference.md` updated). A view-options popover holds a 200/500/1000 window size control (URL-synced as `?n=` and carried through the popout hand-off), 1m/5m/15m time presets over buffered timestamps (anchored to the last completed load so the window freezes while paused, composing with the view-local Clear watermark), a line-wrap toggle, and opt-in relative timestamps with the absolute value on hover. The list virtualizes above 200 rows while preserving follow-tail, gains keyboard navigation (j/k or arrows, Enter expands, `/` focuses search, Esc collapses) keyed by entry identity so live refreshes never teleport the cursor, with a footer hint strip and grid semantics for assistive tech. The filtered view exports as JSONL or TXT, the source rail pivots per server to Metrics, the workspace and detached window now render one shared control cluster (Live/Paused indicator included; the detached footer pulse respects reduced motion), preferred source, level set, wrap, relative time, and window size persist across sessions (URL params always win, and Clear filters resets the persisted source and levels), the command palette gains a Logs section (Errors only, clear filters, wrap, copy, export, window sizes, open detached), and the URL param `?agent=` is renamed to `?source=` with the legacy name honored permanently on read

- MCP-native Traces workspace: the trace list now leads with the tool call, not the trace ID. New Tool and Client columns (promoted onto the summary API from span attributes), relative timestamps with absolute hover, a duration heat bar scaled to the visible page, and a Tool calls | All segment control that hides infrastructure traces by default with a visible "N infra hidden" count; trace IDs move to a hover copy action. Live streaming gains a Pause toggle (display freeze only; collection continues), and a filters popover holds min-duration, 5m/15m/1h/buffer time presets, and clear. The waterfall gains a timeline ruler, self-time on parent spans, a critical-path highlight for multi-span traces, and header actions to copy the trace ID, copy a deep link, and export the trace as spec-shaped OTLP JSON (new `GET /api/traces/{traceId}/otlp`, camelCase keys and hex IDs). Span detail promotes MCP fields first (tool, server, client, transport, replica, model, tokens, and a cost pill from `gen_ai.cost.usd`), collapses the rest under "Other attributes", and surfaces the error message from exception events on failed spans. The list supports keyboard navigation (arrows or j/k, Enter opens, Esc closes) with a footer hint, selection stays sticky across live refreshes, the segment and server filters persist across sessions and deep-link via `?seg=`, the result count shows ring-buffer occupancy against `max_traces` (amber at 90%), and distinct empty states cover hidden-infra, filtered-out, evicted-trace, and tracing-disabled (`GET /api/traces` now reports `tracingEnabled`, `bufferSize`, and `bufferCapacity`). The waterfall pivots to Metrics for the same server alongside the existing Logs pivot. Gateway spans additionally emit the draft-semconv `gen_ai.tool.name` attribute

- The telemetry persistence dot on Stack canvas server cards no longer renders in its "off" state: persistence is disabled by default, so the gray marker sat permanently on every server card as noise. The outlined "pending" ring (persistence enabled but no files written yet, a silent-failure signal) still renders, and per-server details remain in the telemetry sidebar

- Declarative client linking: a top-level `link:` block in stack.yaml lists the LLM clients this stack's gateway should be connected to, and `gridctl apply` reconciles it once the gateway is healthy — so a committed stack file fully describes servers and clients ("clone, apply, clients wired"). Entries are a bare slug (`- claude`) or an object with `group` (links the group endpoint, entry name defaults to `gridctl-<group>`), `client_id`, and `name`. Reconcile is additive and idempotent: already-linked clients are silent no-ops, not-installed clients warn and skip (stack files travel between machines), conflicting foreign entries warn with a `--force` hint, and removing an entry never unlinks anything (removal stays explicit via `gridctl unlink` or the new `gridctl destroy --unlink`, which removes the declared entries on teardown). Validation enforces known slugs, one entry per client, and existing group references; with a `link:` block, `apply --flash` is ignored with a notice; foreground applies reconcile through a new gateway post-ready callback (which also fixes `--flash` never firing under `-f`); `gridctl plan` shows pending link actions in a separate section (JSON: `clientLinks`). The web UI gains a Connections workspace (Cmd+9) listing every supported client with declared/detected/linked badges and staged link toggles applied behind a per-client config diff preview, backed by new `POST`/`DELETE /api/clients/{slug}/link` and a preview endpoint that keep stack.yaml and client configs in lockstep; `GET /api/clients` now reports `declared` and `linkEntry`. The creation wizard grows a Client Link card that opens the workspace

- Compact cards are now the Stack canvas default: nodes render the consolidated view (name, status, token count) unless the full-card view is toggled on via the canvas toolbar or the palette's "Toggle compact cards". Existing installs pick up the new default once; toggling afterward persists as before

- The bottom slide-up panel is removed: its content now lives in top-level workspaces (Logs, Traces, Metrics, and Pins), and the Spec view relocates into the Stack workspace as a slide-over pane opened by the status-bar Spec chip, the command palette, or `/stack?spec=1`. Every workspace gains the vertical space the panel row previously reserved. Cmd+J, formerly the panel toggle, now jumps to the Logs workspace; the "Open Logs", "Open Traces", "Open Spec Editor", and per-trace palette commands deep-link the matching workspaces, "Open Variables" navigates to the Variables workspace, and a server's "View Logs" inspector action lands on the Logs workspace filtered to that server. Detached popout windows are unchanged

- Logs and Traces are now top-level workspaces (Cmd+7 / Cmd+8) alongside Stack, Library, Variables, Tools, Metrics, and Pins. The Logs workspace shows the aggregate stream from the gateway and every server with no node selection required: a source rail (all sources / gateway / per server) filters the same stream client-side, each line in the all-sources view is badged with its origin, and severity, search, and source state live in the URL (`?agent=`, `?level=`, `?q=`) so views are shareable. The Traces workspace carries the full trace list, waterfall, and span detail with URL-synced selection (`?trace=`). The two correlate: a log line with a trace ID pivots to its trace, and a trace's waterfall pivots to the logs for that trace. Detached popouts move to `/logs-window` and `/traces-window` (existing window handles keep working), workspace nav pills collapse to icons below 1360px so all eight fit, and the bottom-panel tabs are unchanged

- Full-view client cards on the Stack canvas are now horizontal: the client icon sits on the left with the name, transport, and linked status stacked beside it in a wider, shorter card, replacing the centered column layout and its dead space above the icon. Compact cards are unchanged

- Automated npm advisory fixes: a scheduled `NPM Audit Fix` workflow runs `npm audit fix` against `web/` weekly (and on demand via `workflow_dispatch`) and opens or updates a single reviewable PR when the lockfile changes, listing the advisories it addresses. Only semver-compatible updates are applied; the frontend CI job's `npm audit --audit-level=high` gate is unchanged, this keeps main passing it so fresh advisories stop failing unrelated PRs

- Tool groups in the web UI: the Tools workspace gains a Groups panel (header button, shown only when a `groups:` block exists) listing each group with its member count, description, copyable endpoint URL, and a link-command hint; selecting a group shows the exposed surface per member tool — the renamed name with its canonical origin, the rewritten description beside the downstream original so operators see exactly what a group client's model sees, and annotation chips for declared hints. Tool rows in the workspace carry compact group badges for members. `GET /api/groups` additionally returns a `members` array with each exposed tool's post-rewrite name, description, merged annotations, and origin. Stacks without groups are visually unchanged

- Tool groups: a `groups:` block in stack.yaml defines named cross-server tool bundles, each served at its own MCP endpoint `/groups/{name}/mcp` and linkable per client with `gridctl link <client> --group <name>` (entry name defaults to `gridctl-<name>`). Membership is servers plus tools minus exclusions; per-tool overrides rename tools at the exposure boundary, rewrite descriptions, and inject typed MCP annotation hints (`read_only_hint`, `destructive_hint`, `idempotent_hint`, `open_world_hint`). Renames exist only at that boundary: dispatch, per-client scoping, limits, schema pins, and telemetry keep operating on canonical `server__tool` names, calls outside a group's surface get a model-readable denial naming the group, and code mode on a group session searches and executes only the group surface. Downstream tool annotations now pass through to clients on every endpoint (they were silently dropped before). Pin fingerprints are untouched by rewrites; `gridctl pins diff` and the diff API flag groups whose description overrides touch a drifted tool, and a rename whose original name still appears in an active skill warns at startup. Validation covers membership references, rename collisions, and the client-side 64-character tool-name budget; edits hot-reload. Surfaces: `gridctl groups` (table, `--verbose`, `--plain`, `--format json`/`--json`, exit codes 0/2) and `GET /api/groups`

- Native skills projection: `gridctl skill project sync <skill>` places selected active registry skills into native client skill directories, so skills work in clients that never fetch MCP prompts (Antigravity, Grok Build) and auto-trigger in clients that read the AgentSkills format from disk. Three targets: `agents` (`~/.agents/skills/`, the vendor-neutral interop dir read by Zed, Goose, OpenCode, VS Code, and Grok Build; always available, created on first projection), `claude-code` (`~/.claude/skills/`), and `antigravity` (`~/.gemini/config/skills/`, always copied since Antigravity's symlink discovery is unverified). Skills are symlinked into the registry by default so edits propagate without a re-sync; `--copy` materializes copies with tree-hash drift detection instead. Nothing is projected until explicitly named (a deliberate divergence from `ctx sync`'s all-by-default: projecting every active skill would flood client discovery context), and the projection set lives in `~/.gridctl/skillsync.lock.yaml` with per-entry ownership, so destinations gridctl did not create are never clobbered silently (`--force` backs up, then replaces) and `unsync` removes only gridctl-created artifacts, backing up copies first. The set reconciles under the daemon after every registry refresh: deactivating, deleting, or updating a projected skill removes or refreshes its projections automatically; the lockfile is flock-guarded so the CLI and daemon never corrupt it. Companion verbs: `skill project status` (SKILL / CLIENT / CHANNEL / STATE / TARGET with in-sync / stale / drifted / target-missing) and `skill project unsync`; all three support `--format json`/`--json` with a `schema_version`, `--plain` where tabular, `--dry-run` where mutating, and 0/1/2 exit codes. The MCP prompt channel is unchanged; docs/skills.md now carries a per-client matrix of which channel reaches which client

- Limit consumption in the Metrics workspace: budgets declared under `limits:` render as consumption-vs-cap bars on the matching per-client, per-server, and per-tool breakdown rows (normal accent, amber past the warn threshold, red when exceeded; a fresh window shows a real $0.00, never the unknown-cost dash), a Limits panel on the overview scope lists every configured budget and rate limit (including entries whose scope has no traffic yet, elevated states first), and a status-bar chip appears when any limit is near or over its cap and jumps to Metrics. The detached metrics window carries the same overlay. Stacks without a `limits:` block are visually unchanged

- Budget caps and rate limits: a declarative `limits:` block in stack.yaml is enforced at tool-call dispatch. Budgets cap attributed dollar spend per client, server, or tool over calendar-aligned daily/weekly/monthly windows (local time; weekly starts Monday), with an optional `warn_at_percent` soft tier; rate limits are token buckets (`calls_per_minute` plus `burst`) on the same scopes. Enforcement is check-then-settle: calls are admitted against recorded spend and settle their own cost after completion, so in-flight calls can overshoot a cap by their own cost and the next call is denied. Denials return in-band tool errors carrying the cap, consumption, reset time, and retry guidance so agent LLMs stop retrying; rate denials include a retry-after hint. Budget spend persists in a ledger under `~/.gridctl/limits/` (independent of telemetry persistence), so a daemon restart never refills a spent budget, and `limits:` edits hot-reload with current-window spend carried over (raising a cap never resets its counter). Code-mode sandbox calls pass through the same enforcement. Budgets govern attributed cost only (unpriced calls settle nothing); rate limits are the documented backstop. Surfaces: `gridctl limits` (table, `--plain`, `--format json`/`--json`, exit codes 0/1/2) and `GET /api/limits`

- Server catalog and discovery: `gridctl search [query]` and `gridctl add <name>` install MCP servers by name instead of hand-written `command`/`args`/`env`. The catalog merges a curated set embedded in the binary (15 vetted servers with correct inputs and secret flags) with the official MCP Registry (registry.modelcontextprotocol.io, API v0.1), fetched on demand and cached for an hour under `~/.gridctl/cache/catalog` with stale-cache and curated-only fallbacks so search never fails because the registry is down. `add` resolves curated names first, then full reverse-DNS registry names, prompts for required inputs (masked secrets are stored in the variable store so stack.yaml only carries `${var:KEY}` references; unset required values become `${var:KEY}` placeholders with a `gridctl var set` hint), renders an import-style plan, and appends through the same backed-up, comment-preserving, validated write path as `gridctl import`. Registry entries map onto stack blocks per package type (`oci` to container images, `npm` to `npx`, `pypi` to `uvx`, remotes to external URL servers with bearer/header auth); `mcpb`, `nuget`, and `cargo` fail with a clear unsupported-type error. Deleted registry entries never appear, deprecated ones warn and require confirmation, and registry results are labeled as community publications rather than vetted entries. Flags: `--source curated|registry|all` and `--plain` on search; `--yes`, `--dry-run`, `--file`, `--name`, `--no-vault` on add; `--format json` or `--json` on both, with exit codes 0/1/2

- Catalog picker in the add-server wizard: the MCP Server template step gains a Templates/Catalog toggle whose catalog view searches the same merged curated-plus-registry catalog as `gridctl search` (new `GET /api/catalog` endpoint, with stale-cache and curated-only degradation when the registry is unreachable). Entries show source-tier badges (curated entries are vetted; registry entries are labeled community publications), deprecation and unsupported-package markers, and required inputs; selecting one pre-fills the existing form, so the YAML preview and review step match what `gridctl add` writes for the same entry, with secret inputs pre-filled as `${var:KEY}` vault references rather than literals

- `gridctl import [client]`: the reverse of `gridctl link`. Scans installed LLM clients for existing MCP server definitions (read-only; client configs are never modified), normalizes the per-client dialects (mcpServers/servers/mcp/context_servers/mcp_servers/extensions keys, Continue's array form, url/serverUrl/uri/httpUrl, transport spellings, Goose's cmd/envs, JSONC and BOM tolerance), unwraps `npx mcp-remote <url>` bridges and Windows `cmd /c` wrappers into direct URL servers, and appends selected servers to stack.yaml through the same comment-preserving atomic write path the web wizard uses, with a `.gridctl-backup-<timestamp>` taken first and the post-import stack validated before a byte lands on disk. Identical servers found in several clients import once with provenance (`found in cursor, claude, vscode`), the gateway's own entry is filtered out, name collisions default to skip (interactive rename or overwrite offered), and plaintext secret-looking env values are offered into the variable store as `${var:KEY}` references with genuine references (`${env:...}`, `${input:...}`, `op://...`) preserved untouched; secret values never appear in output. Flags: `--all`, `--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--file`, `--name`, `--no-vault`, `--format json` (pure-JSON stdout with a schema_version) with exit codes 0/1/2. Claude Code detection now honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`


- Poisoning-aware pins: tool definitions are scanned with local heuristics when a pin is first taken and when drift is presented for approval, covering hidden-instruction phrases (P001), sensitive-file references (P002), sensitive-action language (P003), suspicious emphasis words (P004), hidden Unicode with Tags-block payloads decoded as evidence (P005), and cross-server tool shadowing (P006). Matching runs on normalized text (invisible characters stripped, NFKC, homoglyph and leetspeak folding) so common evasion does not defeat it, and quoted matches are downgraded so tools that document attack phrases are not flagged as attacks. Findings are advisory (info/warn/critical with confidence and matched snippets, always escaped) and surface beside the drift diff in `gridctl pins diff` text and JSON output (schema_version 2), `GET /api/pins/{server}/diff`, pinned records, the Pins workspace (per-tool finding cards, a status-bar findings chip, and a one-time toast), and the add-server wizard's discovered-tools step. Nothing blocks: exit codes are unchanged unless `pins diff --fail-on-findings warn|critical` is passed, the Approve action stays available, and hashes are untouched. Configurable via `schema_pinning.scan` (default on) and `scan_ignore: [codes]`


- Native authentication for external URL servers via an optional `auth:` block: static `bearer` tokens and custom `header` values, plus full OAuth 2.1 brokering (`type: oauth`) that replaces the `npx mcp-remote` bridge. gridctl discovers the authorization server (RFC 9728/8414), registers a client (RFC 7591 with `application_type: native`, or pre-registered `client_id`/`client_secret` for servers like Slack that refuse dynamic registration), runs the authorization-code + PKCE S256 browser flow through a callback on the gateway's own port, validates `iss` (RFC 9207), sends RFC 8707 resource indicators on both legs, and stores tokens encrypted at rest under `~/.gridctl/oauth/` keyed by server URL so one login serves every connected client and survives daemon restarts. Rotating refresh tokens are persisted before first use; a rejected refresh self-heals into a `needs auth` state instead of retry-looping. New `gridctl auth login|logout|status|reset` command group (`--no-browser` and `--manual` for SSH, `--format json` with 0/1/2 exit codes), `/api/auth/servers` and per-server login/wait/logout/reset endpoints, `authStatus` on server status payloads, and an actionable `needs auth` state (never an error) across `gridctl status`, `apply` hints, and tool-call error messages. The add-server wizard probe reuses stored tokens and reports `needs_auth` distinctly

- Declare authentication for external URL servers directly in the add-server wizard: the External URL form gains an Authentication section (bearer token, custom header, or OAuth 2.1) whose secret fields nudge toward `${var:KEY}` references, the YAML preview emits the matching `auth:` block, and Test Connection probes with the declared credentials (auth secrets are scrubbed from probe error messages alongside env values). The authorize flow is also polished: a Cancel button during the waiting phase, closed-popup detection that resets to idle, a clickable "Open authorization page" link when the popup is blocked, a remote-daemon CLI hint, an aborted wait long-poll on unmount, and canvas nodes pending authorization now render amber chrome only instead of co-rendering the red health strip. Auth REST endpoints are documented in the API reference, and troubleshooting covers `gridctl auth reset` plus the token-store threat model

- Surface downstream OAuth authorization in the web UI: servers pending authorization render as an amber "needs auth" state on the Stack canvas (never as an error) with a key indicator on the node, the server sidebar gains an Authorization section (status, issuer, scopes, token expiry, Authorize/Re-authorize and Sign out, with a copyable URL fallback when the popup is blocked), the gateway sidebar and status bar show a pending-authorization count that jumps to the first pending server, the add-server wizard renders a distinct requires-authorization notice instead of a generic probe error, and a one-time toast fires when a server transitions into the pending state

### Refactoring

- Removed the gateway version string from the header, where it sat beside the wordmark competing with the brand mark and the workspace switcher for the app's most valuable real estate. It already appeared on the gateway node in the Stack canvas and in the gateway inspector sidebar, and those are the accurate homes for it: the version is a property of the gateway reported over `/api/status`, so beside the wordmark it read as the version of the web UI itself. This is the third header removal in the same direction, after the gateway-name chip, connection state, and server counts moved to the status bar. Nothing changes when the gateway is unreachable, since the header string was already conditional on gateway info being present; while connected, the version is now reached by way of the Stack workspace or `gridctl version`

- Removed the header Variables panel, a second, weaker rendering of the same vault that could be opened while already standing on the Variables workspace. It never received the usage index, so it showed no consumer counts anywhere, and its delete confirmation omitted the consumer count and bulk-injection warning the workspace shows, making it the less safe of two delete paths for identical data. The header gear that opened it is gone entirely, since the workspace switcher sits in the same header and Variables has been a first-class tab since the bottom-panel removal; the creation wizard's Secret tile now navigates to the workspace instead of opening the panel


- Rename the Topology workspace to Stack in the web UI: tab label, command palette ("Go to Stack"), document title, and cross-references now match the `stack.yaml` / `gridctl` vocabulary the backend adopted when `--topology` became `--stack`. The tab icon changes from a network glyph to a layers glyph to match the label. The route moves from `/topology` to `/stack`; old `/topology` bookmarks redirect

### Bug Fixes

- `GET /api/stack/export` no longer corrupts `${var:KEY}` references. The API's secret sanitizer skipped values already prefixed `${vault:` but not `${var:`, so a canonical store reference was mistaken for a raw secret and rewritten to `${vault:<workload>_KEY}`, naming a key absent from the variable store and breaking an export followed by a re-apply. Values that are already store references now survive in whichever form they were written, and newly sanitized secrets are emitted in canonical `${var:}` form, matching `gridctl export`. No secret was ever exposed: the defect substituted one reference for another, and genuine raw secrets were still sanitized. The CLI export path carried the correct logic already; this brings its API twin in line

- Library workspace bug sweep, five defects. The "Never used" KPI no longer reports the whole active catalog on a freshly started gateway: a usage window younger than 24 hours (matching the backend's own minimum observation period) cannot support the claim, so the card renders a dash instead of a count, goes inert, and explains on hover that tracking has just started and those skills have not been idle, only unobserved. A stale or hand-typed `?usage=unused` is inert under the same condition rather than selecting every active skill, the bulk action bar carries the tracking-window caveat while the window is cold, and bulk Disable now confirms before it writes (previously only bulk Delete did, so one Select all plus Disable from a misleading facet could take the whole library out of service in two clicks with no confirmation). A registry where every skill genuinely is unused after a long window still shows its count: the discriminator is elapsed time, not an empty usage map. `useSkillUsage` now reports `fetchedAt` and `error` so loading, unavailable, cold, and live are four distinguishable states

- Icon-only buttons now expose an accessible name. `IconButton` set `title` but no `aria-label` and rendered a bare `<svg>`, so 276 buttons on `/library` were announced as just "button" and were unreachable by role; `title` is not reliably exposed as an accessible name across assistive technology. Every call site already passed a tooltip, so the name comes from there, with a new `ariaLabel` prop for the cases where the two should differ. `title` is unchanged, so hover text and existing title-based queries keep working. The skill editor's instructions textarea, previously unlabeled, gains a name as well

- `GET /api/registry/skills` no longer ships every skill's Markdown body. Bodies were about 860 KB of a 970 KB response on a registry of 89 skills, and the web UI refetches that list every three seconds on every workspace, so the catalog cost roughly a gigabyte an hour and a Markdown-sized JSON parse on the main thread per cycle, for content no list view reads. The surfaces that render instructions (the inspector's Instructions tab, the skill editor, and the sidebar's expand-row preview) now fetch the single skill on demand, which is both smaller and exact: the preview is one request per expanded row, not 89 previews on every poll. Per Article VIII the original shape stays reachable at `?full=1`. The editor blocks saving until the body has loaded or has failed to load, so an unhydrated editor can never write an empty body over a skill's instructions

- A skill in a flat directory no longer reports its own directory name as its category. `skillCategory('docx')` returned `"docx"`, so on a flat registry every skill became its own one-member category, Group-by-Category degenerated into a list, and Details showed a Category row restating the skill. A category now comes from an explicit `category` in the skill's frontmatter metadata, or from the first segment of a nested `dir`, and is absent otherwise; the Details row, the table's Category column, and the Group-by-Category option all hide when nothing has one

- The skill inspector's file tree gains a sort control (name, size, or path). Files rendered in backend directory-walk order, which is neither stable nor useful for finding one. Ordering applies within each directory bucket, and the control is hidden for a skill with a single file

- Skill import no longer drops supporting files: `gridctl skill add` and `gridctl skill update` now install each skill's `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` directories alongside its `SKILL.md`, plus top-level `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and `COPYING` files. Previously only the rendered `SKILL.md` was written, so a package whose body instructs the agent to run a bundled script (Anthropic's `docx`, `pptx`, `xlsx`, and `pdf` among them) installed clean, reported "Files 0", rendered its full instructions, and then failed at use time with a missing-file error, producing degraded output rather than a visible break. The copy is an allowlist rather than an exclusion list, so a repository-root skill never drags in `.git`, a skill never absorbs a nested skill beside it, and files outside those paths are not copied; symlinks are skipped, per-file size (5 MiB) and per-skill file count (500) are capped, and anything left out is surfaced as an import warning. Executable bits are preserved, since that is what makes a bundled script runnable. `ImportedSkill` gains `filesCopied`. Re-import replaces the three managed directories wholesale so upstream deletions do not linger, and leaves everything else (`SKILL.md`, its timestamped backups, and the origin sidecar) untouched; files added by hand under a managed directory are replaced on the next sync, since the registry cannot distinguish them from imported ones. Known gap: drift detection and fingerprinting still hash `SKILL.md` alone, so edits to installed supporting files are not yet reported as drift and a forced update backs up only `SKILL.md`. Existing installs pick up their missing files on the next `gridctl skill update --force`

- The skill security scan now covers installed supporting files, not just the `SKILL.md` body, and runs against the clone before anything is written, so a skill rejected by the scan leaves no partial install behind. Every text file being installed is scanned, not just recognized script extensions: a git clone only carries 644/755, so an extension allowlist would never look at a non-executable payload, and reference documents are prose an agent reads and acts on once a skill is projected. Binary content is skipped by content sniff rather than by extension. Only high-severity matches block an import; lower-severity matches are reported as findings without gating, because the pattern set is tuned for prose and shell snippets and fires routinely on ordinary Python. Verified against `anthropics/skills`: all 17 packages still import without `--trust`. Relatedly, `gridctl skill update` and the API sync handlers no longer pass `trust` unconditionally: every sync previously refreshed skill content with the scan gate disabled by construction, which was harmless while only the body was scanned and is not once executable files are installed. Syncs now fail closed and report findings; `gridctl skill update --trust` is the opt-out

- `gridctl skill add --rename` now validates its argument. The value becomes both the skill name and the destination directory, and it was previously unchecked, so `--rename ../../x` resolved outside the registry root. Combined with the supporting-file installer above, that would have made a mistyped rename delete `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` under an arbitrary directory. The rename is rejected up front and the resolved destination is asserted to stay within the skills root

- Skill file counts are now recursive. `countSupportingFiles` walked only the direct children of `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`, so a package with `scripts/office/*.py` reported a small fraction of its real contents: Anthropic's `docx` counted 3 files against 59. The Library's Files column and the Files sort now reflect actual package size

- Variables workspace honesty and edit gaps: the usage index served by `GET /api/var/usage` now synthesizes a `secrets-set` consumer for every variable a `secrets.sets` block injects into server env (keys and set names only, never values; a locked vault degrades to explicit references), so set-injected secrets no longer count as "Unreferenced", the inspector's orphan callout with its Delete shortcut only appears for true orphans, consumer rows render the injection ("set: dev · injected into server env"), and the delete confirmation warns about the bulk injection it previously suppressed for exactly those keys. A failed usage fetch now reports "Unreferenced" as unknown instead of counting every variable as unreferenced. The inspector's edit mode gains the type selector and Secret/Plaintext toggle the create form always had (validating against the selected type, with a visibility warning when flipping a secret to plaintext) and seeds the form with the fetched stored value, which also makes explicit empty values savable for types whose validator permits them without ever silently wiping an unrevealed secret. The "Move to set…" select gains an "Unassigned (remove from set)" option (backed by the existing empty-set API; leaving an actively injected set asks for confirmation), the sets rail gains an Unassigned pill (`?set=__none__`), and "Jump to Stack" now actually navigates to the Stack workspace with the node selected and the sidebar open instead of toasting "open Stack to inspect". Search additionally matches consumer server names and field paths ("zapier" finds `ZAPIER_MCP_TOKEN`), consumer field paths carry plain-language tooltips ("argument 5 of the server command in stack.yaml" for `command[4]`), re-locking an encrypted vault shows lock-mode copy instead of first-encrypt copy, first-time encryption enforces an 8-character minimum with a 12+ recommendation (re-lock accepts existing shorter passphrases), unlock failures distinguish a wrong passphrase from transport errors, and a dismissible banner nudges toward encryption while secrets sit unencrypted on disk

- Tools workspace trust and audit fixes: saving an empty tool selection is now refused at every save path (an empty whitelist means expose-all, so Clear then Save silently persisted "disable everything" as "expose everything", including tools just unchecked, and the post-save refresh re-checked every box so the inversion looked like a clean save); the Save button disables on an empty draft and the count line switches to a danger warning instead of the neutral "empty means all tools exposed" help text, in both the Tools workspace and the sidebar editor. Leaving the workspace with unsaved whitelist edits now confirms before navigating (workspace tabs and the Cmd+1-9 shortcuts, plus a browser warning on reload or close), and a Discard button next to Save (in both editors) restores the saved selection in place instead of requiring a server switch to reach the discard dialog. The dirty server carries an "unsaved" chip in the rail, whose enabled/total badge shows live (saved) counts. Audit Mode now reports usage-fetch failures ("Tool usage unavailable", also in the detached metrics window's Per-Tool panel) and shows a loading indicator while the first snapshot is in flight, instead of rendering an empty overlay indistinguishable from all-clean, and global search results carry the used/unused/disabled dot when Audit is on so cross-server unused hunting works from search. The selected tool, audit mode, and lookback window now deep-link via `?tool=`, `?audit=1`, and `?window=` (defaults omitted), the Groups button is always visible with its empty state teaching the `groups:` block instead of hiding the entry point until configured, and the API reference no longer claims a fleet-wide "clear" bulk action that was never shipped

- Metrics workspace session-vs-range honesty: the KPI cards and the header total now follow the selected time range (summed from the same series the charts draw, labeled "Last 30m/1h/6h/24h/7d") with the cumulative session total on its own explicitly labeled line, so the range control owns every headline number instead of only the charts. Breakdown tables are labeled "session totals" (no ranged per-client or per-tool aggregates exist yet), an idle window says "No activity in this window" instead of presenting lifetime numbers unlabeled, and the range round-trips through the URL as `?range=` like scope and selection. The clear confirm now names its real blast radius — token, cost, tool usage, and model history (the endpoint always wiped all of them; the copy claimed tokens only) — and the unreachable cost-only clear is dropped from the web client. The empty-inspector attribution hint only appears while nothing is priced and points at the pricing manager instead of a "Top Clients table below" that only exists on the Clients scope, selecting an entity with no samples in the window shows an explanatory note instead of silently missing sparklines, and the detached metrics window gains the same windowed KPI presentation plus the per-server cost column it never rendered

- Schema-only pin drift is no longer invisible at approve time: pin records now persist the canonical input/output schemas (backfilled automatically on the next clean verify or approve for existing pins; no pin-file version bump, older gridctl simply ignores the fields), and the diff surfaces carry what actually changed. Each modified tool reports `change_kinds` (`description`, `input_schema`, `output_schema`, or `schema_uncaptured` when the pin predates schema capture) plus old/new canonical schemas across `GET /api/pins/{server}/diff`, `gridctl pins diff` (kinds on the `~` line, escaped schema lines in text mode, full fields in `--format json`), and the Pins workspace, which renders change-kind chips, an explicit "description unchanged" line instead of two identical prose rows, a line-level schema diff panel, and a "pinned before schema capture" state for legacy pins. Previously a drift where only the schema changed showed identical old/new descriptions with different hashes, so operators approved schemas they never saw (the MCP rug-pull consent failure)

- P006 cross-server shadowing findings no longer flood healthy stacks: generic tool names (`search`, `fetch`, `query`, and similar) only warn when the description also names the owning server (a qualified reference like "route atlassian search through this tool"), and a bare mention of another server's name is demoted to an info finding, which never lights the findings chip, badges, or toast. Distinctive tool names (`create_issue`) still warn on their own. The troubleshooting and config-schema docs no longer describe these false positives as expected behavior

- Pins navigation now lands somewhere useful: the status-bar drift and findings chips and the rising-edge toasts deep-link to the first affected server via `/pins?server=`, the Pins rail marks servers carrying warn-or-critical findings with a count, and the workspace header tallies drifted servers and servers with findings. The web diff card also renders the `groups_rewriting` advisory the API and CLI already carried, and relative timestamps older than 48 hours now read as days, and past two weeks as absolute dates (previously "853h ago"), across every surface using the shared time formatting, with exact ISO timestamps on hover in the Pins workspace

- Logs workspace correctness and detached parity: selecting a source with no matching entries now reads "No entries match your filters" with a working Clear filters action (source was previously excluded from filter state, so the view claimed "No logs yet" and clear left `?agent=` behind); log rows carry stable identity so an expanded entry stays expanded across the 2s poll instead of drifting with array indices; slog text-format lines with a `trace_id` attribute now parse it onto the entry so trace filtering and the trace pivot work for them; malformed timestamps render a raw-slice fallback instead of "Invalid Date.NaN"; and `GET /api/logs?level=` scans the whole ring buffer for up to `lines` matching entries instead of level-filtering only the last `lines` raw entries, which under-returned sparse severities (the per-server logs endpoint drops its 10x over-fetch heuristic for the same exact scan). The detached logs window now shares the workspace's view core: `?trace=` filtering with a clearable chip, a trace pivot (opens the Traces workspace in a full tab), URL-synced search/level state including the `level=none` sentinel, and source changes that no longer clobber other URL params. The row trace pivot is visible without hover (and on keyboard focus) instead of hover-only, source rail counts reflect the active level/search/trace filters instead of raw buffer totals, and the filter bar labels the poll window ("last 500")

- `gridctl traces` works again against the current API: the list command decoded the pre-#949 response shape and failed with a JSON unmarshal error, the detail waterfall silently rendered zero durations and a blank trace ID, and `--min-duration` sent a `min_duration=` query parameter the API never read (the flag was a no-op since the workspace shipped). The CLI now decodes the served camelCase envelope via its own DTOs, sends `minDuration`, surfaces the API's 400 message on invalid input, and its tests mock the actual served JSON so wire drift cannot pass CI again. `--json` list output is now that envelope (`{traces, total, tracingEnabled, bufferSize, bufferCapacity}`), no longer a bare array of snake_case records. With traces disabled, the list explains how to enable `gateway.tracing` instead of reporting "No traces yet"

- The Traces workspace is now correct on live data. One gateway tool call produces one multi-span trace: a root span (named `<server> › <tool>` in the trace list) parents `mcp.routing`, `mcp.client.call_tool`, cold-start, and format-conversion spans instead of each minting its own single-span trace, so the waterfall finally shows a tree. The span API serializes `endTime` and `parentSpanId` (previously the end time was dropped and the parent key was `parentId`, which the UI never read - selecting a trace showed "NaN" durations, an "Invalid Date" end time, and a permanently flat waterfall; the UI also derives the end from `startTime + duration` when `endTime` is absent and never renders NaN or Invalid Date). Span events recorded downstream now reach the Events panel (they were hardcoded empty). The `minDuration` filter works from the UI: the API accepts both Go durations and bare-integer milliseconds and rejects garbage with a 400 instead of silently ignoring it. Docker/runtime SDK self-instrumentation spans (e.g. `GET /v1.51/containers/json` health polls, ~90% of the buffer, evicting real traces within the hour) are excluded from the UI trace buffer by scope; a new optional `gateway.tracing.include_infra` flag re-admits them, and OTLP export is unaffected. Empty-string span attributes no longer render as blank rows

- Clicking a blank part of the Stack canvas now returns to the default view: every expanded tool fan-out collapses (closing any open tool detail popover) alongside the existing deselect, sidebar close, and zoom-to-fit

- The Stack canvas tool detail popover now stays inside the visible canvas: when the card would overrun the canvas's right edge (the auto-refit frames tool fan-out pills flush against it) the viewport pans left just enough to bring the card fully into view, so it still opens to the pill's right without covering the graph, on both the visible-pill and "+N more" overflow paths. The check reruns whenever the viewport settles, so a refit animation still in flight when the card opens can no longer land it clipped. The canvas also re-frames when its own width changes: opening, closing, or dragging the detail sidebar (a grid column) previously left the rightmost servers clipped behind the panel because the refit only tracked node-set changes, and refits that coincided with the sidebar opening framed against the old width

- The gateway's announced MCP identity is now configurable: an optional `gateway.name` field in stack.yaml overrides the `serverInfo.name` reported in the initialize response (default unchanged: `gridctl-gateway`), and group endpoints announce a group-suffixed identity (`<name>/<group>`). The response also carries the MCP `title` field for clients that prefer it. Clients such as VS Code / GitHub Copilot display the server-reported name rather than the entry key in their own config file, so multiple linked gridctl endpoints were previously indistinguishable in their tool lists

- The Stack canvas now refits the viewport after expanding or collapsing a server's tool fan-out with no client selected, so the revealed tool nodes stay in view at the maximum zoom that fits instead of clipping past the right edge at higher zoom levels. Layout recomputes refit too: the reset-layout button and the compact/full card toggle re-frame the graph instead of leaving the resized layout spilling out of view. Status polls and node drags still never move the viewport. Access Lens now frames the whole graph (every server is grantable, so all must be visible) and refits when tools are expanded or collapsed mid-edit, while grant/revoke toggles still hold the canvas still

- `gridctl link`, `gridctl unlink`, and link status no longer fail with a JSON parse error when a client's config file exists but is empty or whitespace-only (Antigravity 2.0 creates its `mcp_config.json` as a zero-byte file on install); an empty file is now treated the same as a missing one

- Grok Build is now a supported global context sync target writing a managed block to `~/.grok/AGENTS.md`; it was previously misreported as having no documented global instruction file

- Import skills whose SKILL.md `metadata` contains nested values (the openclaw/ClawHub publishing convention): non-string metadata values are now coerced to strings instead of failing the parse. SKILL.md files that genuinely cannot be parsed are surfaced by path and error across the CLI, import warnings, and the UI wizard instead of the misleading "no SKILL.md files found in repository"
- Surface pin drift detail before approval: `GET /api/pins/{server}/diff` endpoint, `gridctl pins diff` subcommand with JSON output and 0/1/2 exit codes, and a first-class Pins workspace where the Approve action sits beside the rendered per-tool diff (non-printable characters escaped). Approvals can be bound to the reviewed snapshot via `expected_server_hash` / `pins approve --expect`, rejecting definitions that change after review
