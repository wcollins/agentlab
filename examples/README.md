## 🎬 Recommended Path

1. **Start here**: `getting-started/mcp-basic.yaml` - stack, networking, tool filtering (placeholder containers)
2. **Real MCP servers**: `transports/local-mcp.yaml` - actual MCP server logic via stdio transport
3. **Platforms**: `platforms/github-mcp.yaml` - third-party MCP servers
4. **OpenAPI**: `openapi/openapi-basic.yaml` - turn any REST API into MCP tools
5. **Python sources**: `python-sources/pypi.yaml` - start with one exact package, then try `daily.yaml` for PyPI and Git together
6. **Registry**: `registry/registry-basic.yaml` - Skills as MCP prompts (imports also discover agents)
7. **Packs**: `portable-pack/` - one manifest importing skills, agents, and rules as a unit
8. **Scaling**: `autoscale/autoscale-basic.yaml` - reactive autoscaling of MCP replicas

> **Note:** Getting-started examples use placeholder containers to focus on infrastructure concepts.
> Transport and platform examples include real MCP server implementations.

## 💻 Usage Pattern

All examples follow the same deployment pattern:

```bash
# Deploy a stack
gridctl apply examples/<category>/<file>.yaml

# View status
gridctl status

# Tear down
gridctl destroy examples/<category>/<file>.yaml
```
